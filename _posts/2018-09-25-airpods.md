title:  "Best Tech Purchase 2018: Apple Airpods"
---
When Apple released the Airpods in late 2017, I did not rush out to purchase them. I have always had problems keeping earbuds in place, so I figured it would be an expensive toy that I would just lose. It took six months of positive reviews, increasing adoption around me and, decisively, a rave review from my sun for me to take the plunge.

The Airpods do not represent a revolutionary change from previous bluetooth earbuds, but they are a big evolutionary increment. They do stay in your ears!  I even tried running with them once and they didn't fall out (though I didn't find the experience to be a comfortable one). They hold a charge for 2-4 hours of listening and then recharge quickly in their little "dental floss" case.  They miraculously connect with any Apple device and unlike other bluetooth devices switch easily among various devices. Individually, none of these things are a very big deal, but taken as a whole, they combine for a very satisfying experience. Airpods have been my most satisfying tech purchase in 2017-2018.
