title:  "Zillow Zestimate"

Attended data science meet-up at Zillow Group in downtown Seattle overlooking Elliott Bay: spectacular office on the 30th floor.  A few valuable take-aways:
- I’m adding Zillow to list of Seattle-based prospects. This is a major technology and data provider in the real estate industry which has used public data about home sales to create an invaluable proprietary business.
- Hosting this meet-up was all about recruiting data scientists and software engineers who work alongside those data scientists. No evidence that these teams are hiring PMs or other non-coding specialists.  The age of the company presenters and the attendees was heavily skewed to early 20s.
- Looking at Zillow’s executive bios and even at the overall job openings, there certainly are folks at the company with much lighter business credentials and intellectual firepower than I have. There are “product manager” positions which look like they could be a fit in terms of the success criteria, but not in terms of how the qualifications are described. That is a gap I must bridge.
According to LinkedIn, I have a dozens second-level contacts at Zillow - this is even without pinging my friends here if they know anyone there.  It’s a longshot, but worth the effort.
