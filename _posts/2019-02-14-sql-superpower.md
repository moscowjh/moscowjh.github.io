A couple months ago I did an online SQL bootcamp as a review. I have learned a few different forms of Structured Query Language over the past few years and understand relational databases. I have used SQL as the backend of a web app, and to pull data from databases for analysis with Python or R.

The particular course was straightforward and engaging. In order to make the exercises more interesting for myself, I set up an instance of Lahman's Baseball Database (professional baseballs statistics going back to the 19th century). It was fun writing both simple and intermediate queries to answer some questions about my favorite historical teams and players.

It was gratifying then to see [Craig Kerstiens blog post](http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2019/02/12/sql-most-valuable-skill/) appear in *Hacker News.* To quote the main points:

> 1. It is valuable across different roles and disciplines
> 2. Learning it once doesn’t really require re-learning
> 3. You seem like a superhero. You seem extra powerful when you know it because of the amount of people that aren’t fluent

Good to know that the skill is a versatile and timeless. Good to know that it's something that not many people - not even all developers - possess. And especially good to know that product managers, like Kerstiens himself, find SQL to be valuable. I'm glad I am investing the time to improve this superpower.
