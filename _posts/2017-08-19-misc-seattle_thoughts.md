BTW - WSJ app for both iPhone and iPad recently improved greatly.  It is good an experience as NYT app and almost as good as the actual paper.

I have started reading the Seattle Times online. Not a very good paper overall, but the coverage of state and regional issues is pretty important to me now.

While up at Monika's house on Samish island, I visited the city of Bellingham just 45 miles south of Vancouver, BC.  Very nice and pretty medium-sized city with a big university (Western Washington).  From Bellingham, there is weekly (biweekly in summer) ferry service to Alaska.  The Canadians drive down to go to CostCo and TJs in Bellingham.

Also, the salmon are spawning. At the Ballard locks they have a fish ladder that allows the salmon to migrate from the sea to Lake Washington (and beyond to their spawning grounds). There is a viewing area from which you can see the big salmon swimming against the current.  Nature is awesome!
