I read Dan Lyons' *Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Startup Bubble* cover-to-cover over the weekend. A former coworker had recommended it as the best book he read all year. I was already familiar with some of Lyons' work notably *Silicon Valley* television series and ["Fake Steve Jobs,"](http://www.fakesteve.net/) a virally popular blog that ran during Steve Jobs lifetime.

Aspects of the book rang true: for instance the descriptions of the type of employees attracted to a growth stage start-up, of mediocre technology buoyed by a hard-sell boiler room operation, and of woefully inexperienced middle (and upper) managers. However, as a memoir of career transition, *Disrupted* resonated a little less than I had thought it might.

For one thing, as a nationally-known tech journalist, Lyons has a distinctive personal brand. At the time covered by the book, he had recently lost his longtime "day job" at *Newsweek*, but had already gone to work at a different media outlet and was also having some success as an independent speaker and writer. Certainly, content marketing at Hubspot was a different vector, but he didn't fully give up the other opportunities (as recounted in the book). And that specific opportunity was available to him precisely because he is a nationally-known tech journalist.

Another thing that stood out to me was Lyons' tone deafness about relationships with peers. He is contemptuous describing Hubspot's corporate bloggers, brand marketers and PR people with whom he worked. When he gives examples of actions that triggered office fights with some of these people, he seems to believe that the accounts support his positions. But when I read these passages (without any other background), my sympathies drifted toward some of his colleagues.

After the book's publication, Hubspot and its allies claimed that Lyons had joined the company with the intention of writing an expose (a claim which he denied). The fact that the company's board fired and disciplined employees for undisclosed misconduct prior to the book's publication diminished the company's credibility. However, I think that Hubspot may be correct in this assertion. By his own account, Lyons was taking careful notes about his experiences from day one. Note-taking may just be in his DNA, as a long-time professional writer, but I am guessing that at least the possibility of writing a book was in his mind. He certainly mined some of these experiences for subsequent work on the very successful *Silicon Valley* series.

Unlike my LinkedIn friend, I'm not going to put *Disrupted* at the top of my 2018 best books list. However, for anyone working in an IT-related field, it is worthwhile.
