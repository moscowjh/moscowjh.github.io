Here's another example of simple data (no advanced stats degree required to understand). Fans and analysts have attributed the recent surge in home runs in Major League Baseball to a lively or "juiced" baseball. MLB officials have denied that the balls were different than in previous years. This year, for the first time, AAA leagues (the highest level of the minor leagues) are using the exact same ball that is used in the Major Leagues; lower level leagues are using a minor-league specific ball as in past years. In other words, this is a controlled lab-style experiment where exactly one variable has been changed for a specific population.  The results are described in the following Twitter thread (be sure to click on the arrow at bottom right of the embedded box to see the entire conversation):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1. Yep, I&#39;m Tweeting about the AAA ball again.<br><br>In AAA right now, players are hitting HRs at 159 percent of the rate they hit them in 2018. Already, AAA hitters have hit 788 more HRs than AAA hit in all of 2018.<br><br>Here&#39;s what&#39;s amazing. At AA/HiA/LoA, HR rates are actually down.</p>&mdash; JJ Cooper (@jjcoop36) <a href="https://twitter.com/jjcoop36/status/1154848818476802050?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


The introduction of the Major League ball into AAA leagues appears to be responsible for a roughly 60% increase in HRs in 2019 vs. 2018.
