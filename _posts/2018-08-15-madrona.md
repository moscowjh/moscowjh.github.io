title:  "Magical Madrona"
---
I experienced a magical side of Seattle this evening.  The home I visited is in Madrona, only about 1 1/2 miles from my apartment in busy Capitol Hill. Madrona is on a very steep wooded hill overlooking Lake Washington. Though not large house, it does have a splendid view of the Lake, Bellevue and the Cascades (the latter not visible today because of our late summer haze). The real magic is not the view, but the  farmstead  my friend has created in her little hillside yard (the side of a ravine).  There are two goats (fittingly for the terrain), several chickens, two huge beanstalks, tomato plants, lettuce, zucchini and probably other plantings I didn't see.

Though very urban (and settled for over 150 years), Seattle has the unique quality of presenting different natural features close to the city center.  You can see Rainier, Mount Baker and the Olympic Range. There are many lakes and the fjord-like Puget Sound.  And very close to the urban center, people are able to create little farmsteads with goats and chickens!

My generous hosts sent my home with zucchini, tomatoes, beans and homemade chevre cheese!
