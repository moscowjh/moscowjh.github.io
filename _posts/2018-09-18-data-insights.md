title:  "Seeing Old Things in New Ways"

While I spend a lot of time training myself to use data science tools and some time learning some of the math that supports the field, I also pay attention to the "art" of data analysis which involves intuition, good judgement and aesthetic sense. I read a lot of items - blogs, articles and some books - written by the field's leading practitioners.  

In the past few days I cam across a couple of gems in disparate places. First, from data journalist Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise*:

> Good innovators typically think very big and they think very small. New ideas are sometimes found in the most granular details of a problem where few others bother to look. And they are sometimes found when you are doing your most abstract and philosophical thinking, considering why the world is the way that it is and whether there might be an alternative to the dominant paradigm. Rarely can they be found in the temperate latitudes between these two spaces, where we spend 99 percent of our lives

I think this comes up in a part of the book where Silver is talking about the rise of "sabrmetrics," the field of advanced baseball statistics and analysis, but it really could apply to any of the data-related fields the book discusses. And while I can't say *why* I think this is true, my intuition tells me it is correct.

Today I came across the following idea in a blog post called [Is “data scientist” the new “programmer”?](http://blogs.harvard.edu/philg/2018/09/18/is-data-scientist-the-new-programmer/) by Philip Greenspun, a veteran software engineer, professor and entrepreneur.  The brief post is worth reading in full (along with reader comments), but the gist is summarized by the following:

> Does the interesting 1970s “programmer” job still exist? While teaching an intro “data science” class at Harvard, I wondered if the person we call a “data scientist” is doing essentially the same type of work as a 1970s Fortran programmer. Consider that the “data scientist” uses compact languages such as SQL and R. An entire interesting application may fit in one file. There is an input, some processing, and an output answer.

I don't have the same experience as the author and can't say from personal experience if he is right, but I did spend my early years in the tech field working in scientific computing, so my sense is that there is more than a grain of truth in the statement.
