One of the great things about the final two weeks of the year is the opportunity to reflect, reassess and to plan. In my life that includes:
- financial and tax planning
- determining whether earlier resolutions, goals and realignment of habits have had a positive result
- planning and prioritization for the next year, and
- spending time and being in touch with family and friends.

During the final week of the year, when business slows down for Christmas and New Year, it is also a pleasure just to enjoy the moment (with or without the presence of loved ones).

Soon enough, everyday life will re-assert itself. New Year's Eve is two weeks from today! And it is also the beginning of Week 1, 2019 (according to ISO 8601 the international date standard).
