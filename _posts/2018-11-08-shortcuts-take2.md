title:  "iOS Shortcuts, Take 2"
---

I [posted last month about Shortcuts](https://moscowjh.github.io/2018/10/15/shortcuts-ios.html), the scripting app acquired by Apple in 2017 and now integrated with iOS. At the time, I created a couple of shortcuts by studying and modifying items that are included in the "recipes" provided by Apple in the Shortcut app's "Gallery" section.

Not surprisingly, I have not used those scripts in day-to-day life, so I decided to go digging a little deeper on the internet to see if any useful Shortcuts had been posted. I did immediately find a script that resizes any photo to a size specified by the user for easy posting to social media and messaging apps. I modified none of the scripts actions, other than giving my own instance of Shortcuts permission to read from other parts of iOS. So I hope that this proves to be a useful script even though some of my most-used apps, like iMessage, automatically resize images.

For my next round of Shortcuts scripting, I have decided to take a different approach. Creating playlists of music that I want to listen to in Apple Music is a time-consuming task. What I would really like to achieve is to automate the following steps:
- browse websites of some of my favorite radio stations
- copy song names from "favorite music" lists or other pages on those websites
- search for those songs in Apple music
- if found, use those songs to populate a Playlist in Apple Music
- repeat automatically on a periodic basis.

If I were coding using a traditional programming language, these bullet points would be an outline for the program. My next step would be to write some "pseudocode" to specify the structure a little further. In this case, I started to unpack some of Apple's "pre-cooked" recipes for Shortcuts with Apple music. I  experimented with one Shortcut which creates a new (empty) playlist every week and another which creates a playlist of the user's top *x* most played songs over period *y*.  This last produced a list that was fun and which I am listening to right now!

I am having a wonderful time with Shortcuts, but I am pretty confident that 99% of iPhone users would find this too time-consuming, tedious or would simply not understand it at all. It feels like another programming technology which most people will not use. I wonder how many great tech careers of the future are being born now as kids use shortcuts to script their parents' phones?!
