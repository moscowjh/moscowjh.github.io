This was a difficult month. After a year of preparation and forethought, my wife and I moved out of our apartment and have separated after 25 years of marriage.  The apartment is about to be sold: we accepted an offer a number of months ago and have been waiting for the legal, financial formalities to work themselves out.  The work item that has taken the longest is getting the approval of the coop board to proceed with the transaction.  Cooperative apartments are a very specific and peculiar form of real estate. I am pretty sure that owning a coop is not an experience I would like to repeat again.
