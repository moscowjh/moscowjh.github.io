On my recent trip east, I had the fantastic opportunity to go to a NY Mets doubleheader with some good friends I had not seen for a while. We got lucky with the weather - warm but not too hot - and it was great to catch up over a shared interest. The Mets ace pitched well to win the first game and the second game was heading towards a Mets loss, which was where I made a big mistake.

In the sixth inning, with the Mets down by 2 runs, I decided that six hours at the ballpark was enough. A two-run deficit is normally surmountable, but the Mets were fielding a weak-hitting line-up and sending out second-rate pitchers. It seemed like the doubleheader was headed toward a split.

On the seven-train back to Manhattan, I checked the game score on my phone. This was probably within thirty minutes of my departure.  And I saw that the Mets were up 5-4 as a result of three homeruns hit in the seventh inning. A three-homer inning is a rare occurence: I don't remember ever seeing one in person. And, of course, the Mets went on to earn the valuable sweep.

Unbeknownst to me, FiveThirtyEight had come out with a guide *[When Is It Safe to Leave a Baseball Game](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/take-this-cheat-sheet-to-the-ballpark-to-decide-when-to-leave/)* about a week before this doubleheader. Had I known about it, with the two-run lead, I might have waited until the 8th inning to be within the 95% confidence interval that the game would have ended the same way. Not sure I would have taken this advice; my gut feeling was that the Mets were going down. I was willing to roll the dice and, on this occasion, I lost.
