title:  "Late Summer"
---
Not feeling the writing bug today, so am going to spend some time outdoors enjoying the beautiful PNW summertime. After August 1 the days are noticeably shorter than they were a month ago and earlier this week the edge dropped off of the consistently hot, dry weather that Seattle experienced for the past month. It still hasn't rained, and probably won't much until September, but there is a slight foreshadowing of autumn in the morning chill. Though I grew up a "boy of summer", in recent years I have started regarding the late summer and early autumn as my favorite seasons.

Hope that I will not have to resort to the device of "talking about weather" often during this month-long blogging challenge!
