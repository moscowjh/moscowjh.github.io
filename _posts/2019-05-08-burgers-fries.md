What fun is having a personal blog if you can't occasionally be frivolous!?

Having just passed the two-year marker here, I can say that I really enjoy Seattle and the wider Pacific northwest! I like the city's neighborhoods, its size, the climate, the scenery and plentiful opportunities to get outdoors. The food is excellent, both in terms of groceries/produce available and restaurants.  I have a small, but sweet apartment, to call home. I am very fortunate.

One thing I have not yet found in Seattle is a burger joint to truly adopt and call my own. Early on, I tried Dick's (the local analog to In-N-Out Burger) and I find their food to be appalling (though it is cheap and stays open late).  The worst item at Dick's are the fries which are soggy and over-salted: McD's fries are a hundred times better. However, since one of their flagship locations is across from the nearest light-rail station, I'll confess to having Dick's when I come from the airport after long travel days.

What I have found at slightly more upscale burger places in Seattle is that either the burgers or the fries are good, but never both.  My current first choice for best burger is Lil Woody's on Capitol Hill. Great burgers, decent shakes, but the fries are regrettably like Dick's (or can I say, "Dick-like?"). Nearby Sam's Tavern is supposed to be the original Red Robin, but its burgers are "meh." However, Sam's steak fries have just the right crispiness and heft to be worthwhile.

It will take me a while to try all the buzzy Seattle burger places (I try not to eat burgers and fries all that often), so I may yet find the perfect combination at one of them. But is it too much to ask that a city excel at both sides of the burger plus fries equation?
