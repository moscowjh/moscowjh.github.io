title:  "Smogcheck"
---
Took the car to the Washington State “smog check” station. It was on SR99 to the north. not quite in the suburbs, but in an area that felt something like Queens around the cemeteries. The procedure was quick (10 minutes) and cheap ($15).  The car passed: I wanted to have it checked because I am bringing it in for routine maintenance today and wanted to know if it needed any work beforehand.  Over the next couple weeks I will get my WA license and re-register the vehicle.  Afterward, I ate Pho at a simple place next door to the emissions place. Good, but not spectacular.  Then went to the bank for my May rent money and introduced myself at the Greenwood branch.  Every municipality or state has its own cadence and specifics around the bureaucracy of everyday life. In Washington, the bureaucrats are all (so-far) calm, pleasant, low-key.  They are reserved; don’t ask a lot of questions, but react pleasantly if you ask them things.

It has been said that I experience every place I visit or live like an FSO, examining and observing.  What do you think?
