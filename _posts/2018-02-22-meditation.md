Today I watched a hummingbird in the tree in front of my window. I was still, paying attention to my breath (inhale, exhale). The bird was perched on a narrow branch for so long that I began to question whether it was in fact a hummingbird. Then it took off, using the rotor-ish movement of its wings to fly motionless next to another branch. Eventually he flew away. This all lasted for a minute or two, it felt like a rather long time, but it probably wasn't long at all. It did feel as though I was really inhabiting the moment.

I started meditating again a few months ago, shooting for  10 minutes of silent mindfulness every day. I have experimented with meditating at different times of the day and I now realize that while it doesn't need to be the very first thing I do, if I wait until mid-day or later, my head is so full of "to-dos" and desires, that it's very difficult to quiet my thoughts enough to sit still even for 5 minutes.  So now, I do it during breakfast (usually after going to the gym) while sipping my first coffee.

My apartment is on a courtyard and the window in the kitchen is at the level of the main branches of four trees, American Hornbeams. The bare tree branches form interesting geometric patterns; if it is windy, they sway and if it is sunny, the tree's shadows array themselves on the wall opposite. It makes for a meditative environment, though some days schedule dictates that my silent meditation take place elsewhere.

Unlike many people who practice different forms of meditation, I am not so busy that it is a coping mechanism to get me through a hectic  day. Still there are times that I am overwhelmed still by my transition to life in Seattle.
