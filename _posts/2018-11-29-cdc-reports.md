title:  "CDC on US Life Expectancy, Drug Overdose Deaths and Suicide"
---
The CDC dropped three US population health reports yesterday. The reports incorporated final mortality data for 2017 and the news was bad. Overall life expectancy at birth declined by one-tenth of a year, the drug overdose death rate increased for at least the 20th consecutive year (with a steeper slope in the past five) and suicide rates increased over the same period.

The national media covered the CDC release as big news: all of the major print and broadcast media contained both fact and analysis. [Betsy McKay of *The Wall Street Journal*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-life-expectancy-falls-further-1543467660?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=2) delivered what I consider to be the most balanced and thoroughly reported article. [The *New York Times* Upshot data journalism group displayed the most elaborate graphics](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/29/upshot/fentanyl-drug-overdose-deaths.html) though it reported as fact the assertion that the opioid epidemic specifically is responsible for the decrease in life expectancy.

Two visualizations in the CDC reports stood out in my eyes. The first was in the report on drug overdose deaths and shows that many of the states with higher than average overdose death rates are located parts of the US where support for Donald Trump was particularly strong in 2016.

The second chart shows an increasing gap between 1999 and today in suicide rates between large metropolitan centers and rural areas. Both charts help us to understand the societal and political polarization between (sub)urban US and our more rural areas.

As an unaffiliated population health researcher, one thing that surprised me was the difficulty of finding downloadable versions of the datasets used for the research. CDC made all of the data tables for its charts available in pdf format only. The data itself comes from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) which is managed by the CDC. There is an interactive portal called 'Wonder' for querying the NVSS, but it required a bunch of searching and clicking around to find it. Once you are on the Wonder page, it is not immediately obvious how to replicate the data used in yesterday's reports.  For a future post, I'll examine the CDC Open Data more thoroughly and review the steps needed to download useful data sets.
