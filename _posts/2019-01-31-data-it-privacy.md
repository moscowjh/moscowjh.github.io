I have been thinking about the connection between data and privacy. Last winter, I was intensively studying statistics and data analytics. When I started to post more regularly, one of my intentions was to document that learning path. I have indeed written about some of the data tools I use, but it has turned out that I have commented more frequently about data privacy and the positions that various corporations have taken on privacy issues.

When I think about why this has happened I realize that privacy is where the proliferation of data and data technologies most affect the lives of the majority of citizens. Our everyday environments and choices we must make have already been profoundly shaped by the kind of commercial data science practiced inside of companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google and many others. In the US, our democracy has been influenced by the data one of those companies, Facebook, collects and the ways in which it has chosen to make that data available to third parties.

I have started to understand that my own analysis of data privacy issues will be enhanced if I make a systematic effort to understand the basic terms and ideas underlying digital privacy. In other words, what does 'privacy' mean anyway and what are the different aspects of it. How have specific technologies that have emerged over the past 50 years impacted privacy and our ideas about it. One place I found to start [my review of terms and concepts related to data privacy is the *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/it-privacy/#Aca). I am sure I will find other sources and plan to continue commenting on privacy in this blog from time-to-time .
