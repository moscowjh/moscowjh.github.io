I took the day off today and drove out to Emerald Downs for the Longacres Mile, the most important race of the year in Washington.

When I was young, horse racing was still one of the top 10 sports in the US. It was in decline, having been one of the top three sports as recently as the 1950s. During the 1970s, when I was a teenager, there were three legendary Triple Crown winners: Secretariat, Seattle Slew and Affirmed.  For the next 40 years, as the sport withered and became a promotional appendage of the casino industry, there was not another Triple Crown winner until 2015 when American Pharoah it.

The Triple Crown (which consists of the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes - all for three year-olds) is not the apogee of racing, but it is emblematic of the sport's public profile in the US.  During my lifetime, dozens of tracks (maybe even a hundred) have closed and those that survive mainly do so because of the legalization of casino gambling.

Nevertheless, racing retains it's appeal as one of the 'basic' sports and something that is accessible to folks of all ages and income classes.  Though it has a reputation as an activity where irresponsible wagerers can lose their cash, the costs of attending and making modest wagers on the races is far, far less than attending any of the big-time professional sports in the US.

Emerald Downs is located in Auburn, Washington, about 20 miles south of Seattle. On a clear day (not today), Mount Rainier is visible to the south. The Longacres Mile is named for Longacres, a track in Renton which from 1933-1992 was the longest operating racetrack in the US. I'd guess than not many who attended today's races are aware of that history.

The track was full today: it was surprising to see a very diverse crowd. My wagering results were poor, but it was still cheaper than a Mariners game, more active as recreation, and lots of fun.
