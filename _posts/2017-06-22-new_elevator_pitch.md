title:  "To Sell is Human: Six Successors to the Elevator Pitch"
---

This week I read Daniel Pink - To Sell is Human: The Surprising Truth About Moving Others. Pink is one of the most popular writers about business today and the thesis of the book that in the post-industrial economy, sales skills have become important in a great many (perhaps even the majority of) occupations.

The book makes a number of good points about selling skills, enumerating what they are, and suggesting ways anyone who is not in a traditional selling role can cultivate those skills.

In my opinion the pithiest and best part in his chapter on the
“6 Successors to the Elevator Pitch”  which actually updates the concept of “elevator pitch.”

The six successor pitches are:

1. One word pitch. eg. “search”
2. Question pitch (eg. “are you better off now than you sere four years ago?”)
3. Rhyming pitch (“If it doesn’t fit, you must acquit.”)
4. Subject-line pitch( i.e., how do you get people to read an email)
5. Twitter pitch (140 characters or fewer).
6. Pixar Pitch (the archetypal storyline of an animated film). Once about a time _______. Every day, _______. One day, _______. Because of that,______. Until finally _______ .  See Emma Coats’s story rules on the Pixar pitch - http://www.pixartouchbook.com/blog/2011/5/15/pixar-story-rules-one-version.html

I found this to be a very insightful framework - certainly food for thought.
