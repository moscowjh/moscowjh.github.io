title:  "Playgrounds of the World"
---

When our children were very young, A and I lived outside of the US for several years.  The four of us had the good fortune to visit some of the great cities of Europe and the Middle East.  Not infrequently, A and I would take turns watching children and running  into museums, ruins or other cultural sites.  We still joke with each other about rushing down the long, narrow corridors of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence just before closing time.  We didn’t come earlier because M needed her mid-afternoon nap.  Neither A nor I have since returned there.

A year or two after this particular incident, when the kids were toddlers, I promised to write an article (or book) called “playgrounds of the world.”  In order to keep M&M happy on our family outings, we had found playgrounds near some of the world’s great sites - the Forum in Rome, the Metropolitan Museum of Art  in New York City, the Japanese Tea Garden in Sa Francisco’s Golden Gate Park. We always saw the site, but usually didn’t spend as much time in them as the adults in the family would have preferred.

As it happens, both M and M are on trips to Thailand this summer.  Our daughter and a college friend, another anthropology major, are making a slow circuit around northern Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.  Their goals are to observe culture, see some great cultural sites (Angkor Wat) and to see places off the beaten path.  Our son and his girlfriend are taking a shorter trip that includes both Chiang Mai and a beach resort in southern Thailand.  Their objectives are to go to an elephant preserve, take a cooking class and to sit by the beach. Both of them planned their trips independently with minimal input or financial support from their parents.

Both kids clearly are comfortable wandering the world and take delight in their travels.  This is clear from their comments and also from the smiles one sees on social media.  Mobile phones and social media sure have changed the experience of foreign travel over the past decade!!!  Their ease and joy in moving around the world, is one of the best inheritances we can claim to have given them.  That and generally having given them tools to be independent, confident, and practical. Yes, it is a dangerous world and as a parent, one worries about their safety wherever they travel.

I didn’t ever get around to writing “playgrounds of the world,” but to M&M  - the world is their playground.
