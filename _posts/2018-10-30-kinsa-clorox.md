title:  "IoT Health Data Marketing: Spooky or Helpful?"
---
The *NYT* [ran this article last week](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/business/media/fever-advertisements-medicine-clorox.html) about a company called Kinsa which produces 'connected' thermometers which connect with a smart phone app and, eventually, with Kinsa's servers. Kinsa is aggregating data by zipcode and providing it to the The Clorox Company, so that the company knows in real time which zipcodes have increases in fevers.  According to the *Times*, Clorox is using that data to target ads for its disinfecting products.

The article goes on to cite examples of products from Sony, Amazon and Google that are (or could be) used to collect personal data and share them with advertisers. The point isn't to blow the whistle on current misuse of data, but to point out that exposed consumer data are both massive and currently unregulated.

> Christine Bannan, the consumer protection counsel at the Electronic Privacy
> Information Center, said that even though Kinsa appeared to be using the
> information in a privacy-compliant manner, its business model highlights the
>  need for federal regulation around how consumer data is handled.

Given the US tech industry's poor record on proactively protecting consumer data, I have to agree with Bannan's point.
