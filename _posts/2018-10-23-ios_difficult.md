title:  "iOS is difficult!"
---
I am a long-time user of Apple devices. A few years ago, after experimenting with other systems including Windows and Android, I decided to go all Apple with a phone, tablet and a Mac. My philosophical preference for open standards aside, I have been pleased with the results of living in an integrated "walled garden" because it is convenient to have the same or similar apps everywhere and many apps, notably Apple messaging and photos, automatically stay in sync among the various devices.

That said, I have been struck while helping my parents with their iPads and observing elderly acquaintances struggle with their iPhones, that iOS is not the intuitive, user-friendly system that Apple portrays via marketing and advertising. A Toronto-based accessibility specialist, Joe Clark, has published [a blog post which is very thorough in documenting iOS' UX failings](https://blog.fawny.org/2018/10/22/hardtouse/).

Three of my favorite items from the post:

1. iOS poorly documented, difficult to use and slightly dangerous "undo" action (you have to shake the phone). Undo is badly needed, but I had never heard about this implementation before.
2. Selecting multiple photos in one action in the Photos app. I still haven't tried this and am mystified why this isn't more obvious or better documented.
3. The way that the control for adjusting text size is hidden deep within the Accessibility preferences. This is a configuration needed by most people over 40.

There are lots of other examples in the blog post. Some of them were things I know how to do, but plenty were news to me. I think most iPhone and iPad users will benefit by reading it.
