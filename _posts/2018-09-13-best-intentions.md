title:  "Best Intentions"
---
Early this year I leveraged my network to arrange meetings with a company that is engaged in an area of both past and aspirational professional interest. It seemed that this company could benefit from my past experience and since its primary function is to help organizations make sense of their existing data, it is directly connected to my current interest.

The networking went well. The meetings were pleasant and I met with a talented and interesting person at this company. The company was in the midst of hiring some potentially appropriate roles, so my contact referred me to the company's HR department.  I had a meeting with the lead recruiter: it seemed like everything went well. I didn't walk away with any promises, but it seemed likely that my resume would be in the mix for available positions.

Almost immediately, I got distracted by a consulting engagement that took me out of the country and kept me busy for several weeks. When I got back to Seattle, I intended to get back in touch, but for different (bad) reasons, I have not picked up the thread. Today I finally learned that shortly after my meetings with them, the company was acquired by a larger company in the same industry. I know from past corporate experience that mergers and acquisitions often result in a completely hiring freeze and are particularly disruptive to the corporate functions (including HR/recruiting) of the acquired company.

The take-away for me is that, by losing sight of the goal, I may have missed some opportunities. Though it is unlikely the old company would have hired me after the merger was announced, it is possible that there were or are interesting things happening at the merged companies. At a minimum, I lost contact (hopefully temporarily) with dynamic young contact in the data analytics field.
