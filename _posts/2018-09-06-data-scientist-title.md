title:  "What is a Data Scientist"
---

In Michael Lewis's new audio book *The Coming Storm* there is an aside which asserts that the term "Data Scientist" was invented at LinkedIn where DJ Patil was heading up the data insights team. The account is echoed in numerous sources, for instance the O'Reilly Media book *Doing Data Science* by Cathy O'Neil, Rachel Schutt:

> Not long ago, DJ Patil described how he and Jeff Hammerbacher—then at
> LinkedIn and Facebook, respectively—coined the term “data scientist” in 2008. > So that is when “data scientist” emerged as a job title. (Wikipedia finally
> gained an entry on data science in 2012.)

If true, that is incredibly recent. I am skeptical because there are lots of easy-to-find references to "data science" which go back to at least the 1970s. It's possible that no one thought to create a job title until 2008.

Job titles in the field are many - data scientist, data analyst, data engineer, machine-learning engineer, to name the most common ones. There are definitions for each of these positions, but they are not consistent. As someone who has been self-training in the field for the past year, I find it difficult to describe myself as a "data scientist" because my background in statistics is quite shallow, my mastery of the commonly-used tools is intermediate, and my experience working with various kinds of data sets is limited.  The "data scientist" title feels like something that needs to be earned. But I'm not sure that's the way that companies and practitioners are using the term.

BTW Lewis's *Coming Storm* is largely about data and the impact that data science has begun to have on our world. It's also about the US National Weather Service and the gap between the benefit that government services provide and the understanding of those services by US citizens and politicians.  Like all of Lewis's work, the story is well told and the themes are important. It's very worthwhile.
