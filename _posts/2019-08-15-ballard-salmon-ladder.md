One of the essential Seattle sightseeing stops is the salmon ladder at the Ballard Locks. It is "essential" as opposed to "iconic" because it is basically an underground tunnel which runs alongside the locks so it looks and feels like a bunker in a Federal facility (the Locks are run by the Army Corps of Engineers).

The "bunker" is flanked by thick windows which allow the human viewer to see what is happening underwater. What is supposed to be happening - at least during the summer months - is the migration of salmon upstream from Puget Sound to Lake Washington. When I first arrived in Seattle two years ago, I was amazed by the sight: it helped a newcomer to understand the miracle of the PNW environment which is what drew humans here in the first place.

So it was with considerable sadness that I read [this article](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/seattle-as-museum-tourists-can-still-see-wild-salmon-at-the-ballard-locks-on-video/?utm_source=marketingcloud&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Morning+Brief+8-14-19_8_14_2019&utm_term=) in the *Seattle Times* and learned:

> This summer only 17,064 sockeye were tallied passing through the Locks over two months of counting, the lowest figure ever recorded (the counting started in 1972).

> It’s not just lower by a little. The annual average as recently as the decade of the 2000s was 237,000 sockeye through the Locks.

That the salmon population has declined drastically is not a secret. The struggles of the Puget Sound Orca pods are front-page news in the *Times* and it is pretty clear that their root cause is the depletion of salmon populations which are a primary component of the whales' diet. What is remarkable about the locks and the salmon ladder there are that they are man-made, engineered structures. As Danny Westneat, the *Times* commentator wrote in 2006, “So much wildness surging through the city has the feel of a miracle to it."

It is very gloomy to consider the prospect of the PNW without abundant salmon, but a number of experts consulted by the *Times* believe that is exactly where things are headed.
