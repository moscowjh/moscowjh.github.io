title:  "Weekend Link: Insight Timer"
---
As noted before, one of my daily habits is to take 10 minutes in the morning for silent meditation. The meditation helps quiet the noise in my head and to center myself. More often than not, I find my mind wandering to "to-do" lists for the coming day, but I am reasonably adept at catching myself and bringing my focus back either to my breath or to the beautiful green world in the tree outside my window.

I also use a smartphone app, [Insight Timer](https://insighttimer.com/) to help get my mind ready to meditate. Insight Timer is not the most famous meditation app (that would be Headspace), but it may be the most used, according to the CEO of the little company that runs it. I appreciate that the company offers the basic app free-of-charge, with in-app purchases for special courses and other offerings. Headspace charges a hefty monthly subscription. I mostly do silent meditation, so use Insight Timer as, well, um...a timer. Every once in a while, it is fun to try out one of the free guided meditations. For anyone who wants minimal, unobtrusive and free help with a meditation practice, I recommend Insight Timer.
