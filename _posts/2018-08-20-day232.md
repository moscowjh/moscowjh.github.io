title:  "Day 232"
---
It is still August, late summer.  Seattle is covered in smoke that is coming from forest fires in British Columbia, eastern Washington and California. It's not as hot as it has been, probably because the smoke is  blocking the sun. Sunset was orange and gray: at times you can see ash falling from the sky.  Still it is summer - day 232 of 2018.

I had an errand to run today. It was to secure a venue for a holiday party that will take place in mid-December on day 347 of 2018.  In January-February, the winter seems endless and it feels like forever before the heart of the year begins.  Then, before  you know it, it's time to plan holiday parties and the end of the year starts approaching.
