Most people I know in Seattle do their shopping in large supermarkets like QFC or Safeway, supplemented by the occasional trip to a big box like CostCo or Target. Online ordering and/or delivery are also increasingly popular probably because Amazon, based locally, is pushing its grocery e-commerce services.

However, in several neighborhoods I am aware of - Ballard, Roosevelt, Beacon Hill and Bothell - there are still produce markets which appear to have direct relationships with nearby farms and which feature fresh, widely-varied and inexpensive produce. Most of these markets are "roadside stands" in that they occupy B-minus real-estate near a highway or busy thoroughfare.

When I first moved to Seattle, I was fond of the Ballard stand, Top Banana, a short drive from my apartment at the time. There are other shopping options near my current home, including an excellent food coop and the Capitol Hill Sunday farmer's market, but no produce stand. So I could not help but smile with a personal connection when the *Seattle Times* Gabriel Campenario, the "Seattle Sketcher," posted about MacPherson's Fruit and Produce in Beacon Hill.
