title:  "Weekend Listening: Creativity in Daily Life"
---

I have returned from an unplanned blogging break. Good to be back in the groove and I will start my "comeback" simply by highlighting this weekend's podcast listening. People today tend to use the term 'creatives' to denote artists, designers, musicians, etc. working in the business world. Every once in a while when I hear about someone like Lyle Troxell, interviewed on the freeCodeCamp podcast, it reminds me that there are some individuals who bring creativity to whatever they do - even if they don't fall into a category where "creatives" work. For anyone interested in being an autodidact, changing careers, studying software development or maintaining a rich creative life while working a career, this is a highly worthwhile listen.
