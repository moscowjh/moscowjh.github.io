title:  "iPhone is Enormously Underpriced"
---
Warren Buffett said last week during an interview with CNBC, â€œthe iPhone is enormously underpriced...in terms of its utility to people." This statement is absolutely correct and is worth unpacking.

First, it's worth noting that the statement is slightly contrarian. In 2017, when the new iPhone X was announced, the most common critical question in product reviews was whether it was worth $1000 as opposed to the $700 Apple planned to charge for lesser or older phones in its line.  

Buffett is absolutely right to reframe the question. It's not really whether a device is more expensive than other similar devices, but whether it helps the user to accomplish things that she finds valuable.  And further, whether competitors do that same thing equally well and for what cost.

For the technological human in 2018, the smartphone is hands-down her most valuable device. It is a kind of Swiss Army knife of telecommunications and computing that has superseded scores of other everyday items. The cost of all of those things added together would surely come to over $1000. So a best-in-class smartphone with superior design and the most convenient apps is surely underpriced at $1000.

Buffett also makes the point that because of the competition, Apple could not charge much more than it already does for the iPhone. That's true - if Apple suddenly decided to charge $2000 for its flagship phone, a lot of people would probably decide to switch to the top-of-the-line Samsung Android phone at $1000. The Samsung is also underpriced relative to the utility it provides its users.

Buffett does make some curious comparisons. He notes that he spends $1 million  per year maintaining an airplane. And he admits that he doesn't use an iPhone himself.  But "if I used the iPhone like all my friends do, I would rather give up the plane," he said. He also compares the iPhone's utility to a dinner party. He adds, "you can have a dinner party that would cost that ($1000), and here this (the iPhone) is, and what it does for you, it's incredible."  Point taken that there are lots of ways to waste $1000, but buying a new iPhone is not one of them.

The entire discussion came up in the context of an stake in Apple that Buffett had purchased for Berkshire Hathaway.  He was explaining to the interviewer why he considers Apple to be a good investment even now that it is at a historic high. He mentioned his high opinion of Apple's leadership, namely CEO Tim Cook. He also said that he would rather have purchased more earlier at a lower price. He then used the iPhone's utility as a way to illustrate that he believes that Apple still offers a compelling value proposition and that will increase the value of his investment.

I don't know whether Buffett's assessment is correct, but the way he has of framing the value proposition in a simple, direct way is refreshing. It probably is one of the reasons he is one of the all-time greats in the field of investing.
