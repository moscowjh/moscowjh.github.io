title:  "Weekend off and Upcoming Publishing Schedule"
---
It was tempting to continue my posting streak, but I decided to take the weekend as a break from writing. Among other things, I caught up on some reading.  I mentally began composing posts at a couple of moments which is a good sign: even if not posting daily, the writing and imagination should never stop.

As a next step, I'm going to try to publish on the following schedule with the themes as indicated:
- Monday: discussion of a topic from my weekend reading (weekends are usually when I catch up on "longreads" and have a chance to reflect on things during longer bouts of excercise).
- Tuesday and Thursday: will write about 'work.' Themes will come from stats/data, tech business, job hunting, etc.
- Friday or Saturday: I will post a link to an article, photo, video song or something similar. This will be very light on the commentary.

So I'm putting myself on the hook to do this four times per week. Let's see how it goes.
