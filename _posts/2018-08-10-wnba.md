title:  "Watching Basketball in Summertime: Go Storm!"
---
Top-level basketball in US is mainly a winter sport contested among "gym rats." People tend to forget that from playground ball to the Olympics, the sport also has its summertime traditions. Last month Max got to attend the NBA Summer League in Las Vegas, a newer part of the summer tradition.

I have attended two WNBA games within the past month between the Seattle Storm and, two other good teams, Dallas and Minnesota. I  also watched a bit of the WNBA all-star game a few weeks ago.  I had attended games before, one shortly after the league launched in the late 1990s, and also went to games played by the NY Liberty, one of the league's less stellar teams.

Notwithstanding the "W's" commercial failings, the quality of basketball on display in Seattle this summer was excellent and a few of the personalities both on the Storm and playing for the opposition were quite compelling and fun. The games were more competitive and entertaining than desultory mid-season baseball.

I'm hoping that the Storm finish out the season strongly (they currently have the best regular-season record) and are able to win out in the playoffs!
