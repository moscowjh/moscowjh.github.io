This blog documents my interest in data science and other data technologies - advanced analytics, database technology, machine learning, etc. While these topics represent more advanced aspects of the field, I am often reminded that the biggest gains that both organizations and individuals derive from data is to just sit down to review and think about basic statistics.

The [linked article written by political economist, Anatoly Karlin, which reviews the latest demographic data released by the Russian Federation is a case-in-point](http://www.unz.com/akarlin/russian-demographics-in-2019/). The summary highlights what may be the most significant data point:

> The population was estimated at 146,793,744 as of Jan 1, 2019, down from 146,880,432 exactly one year ago. This implies about 131,706 in long-term net immigration, down from 172,551 last year.
>
> If accurate, this would mark the first time since 2007 that the population of Russia has declined in absolute terms*.

Other key demographic data is visualized in the post; for instance:

For those interested in contemporary Russia, the data contained in the article is extremely worthwhile. My field of graduate study and early professional expertise was Russia, so it is an area I will continue to follow here.
