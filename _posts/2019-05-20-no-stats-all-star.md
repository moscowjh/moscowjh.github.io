Concurrently with the NBA playoffs, I have been reading the Library of America's anthology "Basketball: Great Writing About America's Game." One of the anthologized articles is Michael Lewis's ["The No-Stats All-Star"](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/magazine/15Battier-t.html) published in the *NYT Magazine* in February 2009.

The article is a seminal piece of writing about NBA data analytics in the same way that Lewis's "Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game" (2003) is the most influential book about major-league baseball analytics. What amazed me about rereading "The No-Stats All-Star" was how completely the article anticipates much of what has happened in the NBA over the past decade. Daryl Morey is still the head of basketball operations for the Houston Rockets and has used his analytics savvy to make the Rockets the primary challenger to the competitive supremacy of the Golden State Warriors (another analytics-oriented team). Many of the tactics and metrics discussed in the article were unfamiliar to readers at that time, but have become commonplace and standardized throughout the NBA.

Lewis portrays Shane Battier, the "no-stats all-star" of his title very positively, as the ultimate team player and also as a rare pro athlete capable of acting on the tools provided by modern data analytics:

> Before the game, Battier was given his special package of information. “He’s the only player we give it to,” Morey says. “We can give him this fire hose of data and let him sift. Most players are like golfers. You don’t want them swinging while they’re thinking.”

I recently listened to a [podcast interview of Battier](https://businessradio.wharton.upenn.edu/episodes/wharton-moneyball-february-13-2019/) who in retirement from the NBA has become both head of analytics for the Miami Heat and a philanthropist. In the interview, he was incredibly modest in his self-presentation and patiently answered many questions about his career, the Lewis article and about basketball analytics. I will say it is one of very few podcast interviews to which I am interested in re-listening.
