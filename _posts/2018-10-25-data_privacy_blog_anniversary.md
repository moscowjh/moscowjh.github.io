title:  "Data & Privacy"
---
One theme that I will be exploring in future posts will be online privacy.  This is related to data science because when people speak about "privacy" in the digital context, it primarily has to do with what tech companies and governments do with data they collect from individuals both directly (via user accounts, forms, surveys, etc.) or indirectly (via cookies, ip addresses, geolocation and the like). Skillful and ethical use of data holds great promise for improving lives all over the world. Where I see them, I'll give examples of the positive use of data gathered via technology. However, there are many counter-examples of data being used unethically for corporate profit and to undermine civil society. Both instances will seem much less abstract and more "real" when I discuss some specific examples in upcoming posts.

On a lighter note, today marks the two-year anniversary of this blog. It took a while to build up momentum, but I am  pleased with how it has shaped up in the last few months starting with my 30-day blogging challenge in August. I'm planning some changes for the next few months and look forward to sharing them.
