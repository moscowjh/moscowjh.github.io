title:  "Amazon Growing as Advertising Platform"
---
*The Wall Street Journal* published an [in-depth report today on Amazon's emergence as a major online advertising platform](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-with-little-fanfare-emerges-as-an-advertising-giant-1543248561) (linked article is unfortunately behind the *WSJ* paywall). The e-commerce and cloud computing giant is beginning to make a dent in the huge advertising market share of Google and Facebook.

A few things (not necessarily the authors' main points) stood out for me in the article:
- Google and Facebook are treated as long-time incumbents in online advertising and as much more polished than Amazon in ad sales and marketing. More polished they almost certainly are, but people forget that Amazon is the older company (founded in 1998) vs Google (1998) and Facebook (2004). It's still a young and relatively dynamic market.
- The article has a graphic depicting the many different places on a typical Amazon e-commerce page where advertising might appear. To me, this image highlights both the opportunity for Amazon and the risk. On the one hand is the revenue opportunity for ads and product placements. On the other hand, if Amazon causes its customers to perceive that the shopping experience is degrading because of quantity or quality of advertising, it could adversely affect the company's commerce revenue.

In my view, none of the current market share is etched in stone. Facebook has undermined trust in its social network with its disregard for user privacy and societal stability. If the loss of trust is permanent, it will make FB a much less compelling ad platform. Google has kept the search experience (including its advertising component) fairly clean, but the company has problems in other areas that may lead to regulation or even breaking up the company. Amazon has grown relentlessly and has an opportunity, but not any kind of certainty, in advertising.
