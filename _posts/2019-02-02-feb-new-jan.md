Typically, I am happy and excited at the beginning of the New Year. Even in middle age, there is something wonderful about a clean slate. New Year 2019 was fine, enjoyable as ever, but the month of January was really busy for me with family duties. Some of it was fun and some was obligation - it is a pleasure to have the family to care about and who cares about me.  As a result, I did not find the time to reflect on the year ahead and on making changes to improve my life.

So here we are at the beginning of February. I am back in Seattle after two weeks away and have had time for my reflection. I have resolved to simplify my daily routines and to reduce recurring monthly expenses. I will focus my habits and daily efforts on reviving my professional life which has really been crap for the past few years. I have already taken steps to make both of these things happen.

It feels like a moment right before big changes. It is still winter, but here in the Puget Sound region, plants and trees are starting to bud. The days are getting longer after all. Very likely, I'll be doing some more travel soon to help my parents and by the time I return here, spring will be considerably advanced. Right now, I feel optimistic and positive about the remaining 11 months in 2019.
