title:  "What I Learned"
---
Today is the final day of my blogging challenge. I did it! I posted every day in August, but it was not easy.  There were many days where I left the writing until late in the day and ended up writing a perfunctory item. Here are the main things I learned by doing this:

- To the extent that one is trying to explain or think through real topics, it's better to plan and draft posts over several days. Draft, edit, re-write. Duh!
- Even for a personal blog, it makes sense to have a publication schedule of some kind. It's perfectly acceptable to designate certain days for links or videos or photos. You're doing it for personal growth, so no need to turn it into a daily grind.
- The ability to write cogently and quickly is like a muscle. If you exercise it, the muscle becomes stronger and it gets easier to write. In some cases, as with [the entrepreneur I cited in yesterday's post]({% post_url 2018-08-30-writing-well %}), the skill is valued
- I was wrong in my [kickoff post]({% post_url 2018-07-30-blogging-streak %}) about not having enough to write about. It certainly helps to have a theme or topic, in my case statistics, analytics and data science, but any thinking person can come up with a list of draft topics and can scribble notes about those topics. Doing this in advance, before posting date, is highly recommended.

So what next for this blog?  I probably won't be posting every single day, but I am going to determine a weekly posting cadence and will enter those into my scheduling system as either appointments or to-dos. I will continue to write about my journey in stats and data analytics as well as topics of personal interest.  In the near future, I'll see what I can do about improving the site visually (probably by installing a new Jekyll theme) and organizationally. I think that's it...until I change my mind.
