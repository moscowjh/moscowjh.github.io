For the first time since moving to Seattle I  attended live musical performances this week. It wasn't my intention to wait so long: this spring I twice had tickets to beloved bands, but the timing didn't work out. Today it is so simple to listen to everything on demand, that it's easy to skip the expense and the bother of going out. However, when you do that you also forego a huge part of the reward. It's more work to listen to songs in a venue and to interact as a crowd with the performers, but it is so much better in ways that are difficult to put down in words.
