title:  "Seafair"

Seattle holds a monthlong event called [Seafair](https://www.seafair.com/) in the summertime. As near as I can tell, Seafair is a relic of an era when the city was a remote, medium-sized manufacturing and shipping center. My friends, even those who have lived here for decades, pay it very little heed. Nevertheless, Seafair is difficult to ignore if for no other reason than the Blue Angels precision flying team which roars over the city and Lake Washington for several days. Personally I love watching the Angels and they fly directly overhead so you see them really, really close. The jets make such noise that I am surprised their presence doesn't cause any controversy.

Every city has its own culture and traditions. I don't know of any exact equivalent to Seafair in New York, Washington, LA or San Francisco. It's something I'm trying to understand and appreciate.

Here's a video of the Blue Angels at last year's Seafair:
