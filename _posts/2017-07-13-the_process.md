title:  Honesty and "the Process?"
---
One struggle I have with this kind of writing is how truthful to be.  It's easy to write a post where the qualities or activities are described in a positive light. There are plenty of times when my self-assessment is  darker: where I believe I have been ineffective, lazy or bad in some way.

It's true that upon reflection or discussion with a confidant, you realize that these bad times are part of "the process" and were necessary. But, to be perfectly honest, there are times when we all fail to meet expectations.

I'm definitely feeling that way at the moment.  Any momentum I had going back in late June dried up over the July 4th holiday. I'm starting to question how long it will take me to start generating meetings with consequential people that I would like to have in Seattle.

Is this just part of "the process"?<sup>*</sup>

<sup>*</sup>"The process" is a reference to the long-slow rebuild undertaken by the Philadelphia 76ers under GM Sam Hinkie. Hinkie was fired from his job two years into "the process" even though the team is recognized as a rising power in the NBA.
