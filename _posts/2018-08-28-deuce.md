title:  "Tennis Statistics with R using 'Deuce'"
---
Yesterday I began exploring publicly-available pro tennis data using the R package "Deuce" created by the data scientist, [Stephanie Kovalchik](http://on-the-t.com/about/). I had not used R-Studio much recently and, as mentioned in a [previous post]({% post_url 2018-08-23-r-studio %}) have less confidence in my R skills than I do with the Python data analysis tools. There are also some raw [pro tennis datasets](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp) available which would could be downloaded and used with Python. So why did it make sense to use "Deuce?"

One big reason is that once installed as an R package, the "Deuce" utility manages loading of data  in real time from the internet. This provides access to the most recent data and also makes it possible to download only needed records rather than large flat files containing all match data for decades. Another reason is that "Deuce"  contains functions that Kovalchik has written for doing certain common queries (eg. downloading a player's match records for a given year).

At this point, I am simply exploring the data sets to understand what is there. One way I am accomplishing that is by working my way through sample code provided by Kovalchik.  The display is a plot she created to answer the question, are top tennis players getting older based on participants in Grand Slam tournaments since 1990.

I am really impressed by Kovalchik's work on "Deuce" and enjoyed working through the code to celebrate the first day of the 2018 US Open!
