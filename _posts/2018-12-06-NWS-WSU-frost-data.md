title:  "Frost in Western Washington"
---
When reviewing my Twitter feed recently, I came across the following item from the National Weather Service:

What this is saying is that the 'growing season' (i.e., the time of year without any frost) in western Washington has been unusually long in three of the past four years.

I was curious to see complete frost data over more years, so I did a Google search for "first last freeze seattle."  The search returned links to a number of gardening sites and also to [AgWeatherNet of Washington State University](https://weather.wsu.edu/).  On the Frost Dates section of AgWeatherNet, I was able to find last and first frost dates going back nine years to 2011.

Interesting that this data doesn't coincide at all with the NWS tweet! According to the WSU data, 2018 had the second **shortest** growing season of the past eight years! The conclusion this draws me to is not about climate change or any other profound topic. My 'research' has been extremely superficial: I have not, say, gone digging on the National Weather Service site for its frost data. The point is simply that data is often messy, even when it is seemingly simple and non-controversial. In this case, I am personally not invested enough in this question to figure out why there is a discrepancy. That would be a fun university research project: I will leave it for someone else to take up.
