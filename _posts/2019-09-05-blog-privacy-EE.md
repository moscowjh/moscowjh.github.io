A few brief thought threads for today's post.

---
Posting daily is **hard**. A few notables including those cited in [my earlier post]({% post_url 2019-08-14-starting-new-streak %}) have spoken about the benefits of posting public writing daily. It's really difficult to accomplish, even if "daily" means 5x/week. And when I have worked up a streak of a few days in a row, I have made typos and errors in dating and tagging the posts. It helps me to understand when I am exposed to professional bloggers (and social media "influencers") that an awful lot of planning, editing and tech quality control is built into the work.

I discovered that [the piece I cited from the *Washington Post* about Ring doorbell technology]({% post_url 2019-09-03-ring-amazon-privacy %}) was based on reporting originally done by BuzzFeed.  The *Post* did cite [the BuzzFeed article}(https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/amazon-ring-facial-recognition-ukraine), but skipped a number of the points made there. BuzzFeed reporters studied job postings for developers at Ring's Ukraine subsidiary to understand that the company is doing R&D on facial recognition. Amazon has declared that facial recognition is not used in Ring products (probably true for current products), but this does not diminish fears of the potential use of facial recognition software to violate citizen's privacy.

Very interesting to me that Ring has software engineering in Kiev. Eastern Europe has a very deep vein of scientific and engineering talent, as I myself experienced, but it is a constant challenge to overcome US/Western European fears about trust and cybersecurity.
