title:  "US Open Tennis"
---
The US Open tennis tournament has always figured prominently on my personal calendar. In 25 or so years living in New York City, it was an event I attended frequently. Before that, viewed on television as a teenage tennis player, it was the setting for epic battles among the champions of the 1970s. Watching those battles helped to stoke my desire to go to Columbia.

The last of the four annual major tournaments is also a passage from summer into autumn. It begins on the last Monday of August, spans Labor Day weekend, and finishes sometime around September 10.  Often the weather during its first week is uncomfortable hot. Typically there are torrential rains at some point (people forget how severely hurricane season affect the Mid-Atlantic states). And evening matches during the final week very typically are played in an autumnal chill.

The late David Foster Wallace wrote some of the best non-fiction on the subject of tennis. These writings are collected in [String Theory](https://www.amazon.com/String-Theory-Wallace-Library-Publication/dp/1598534807) which I recommend to anyone with an interest in tennis who also values fantastic writing.  The [most famous of the pieces, about the great Roger Federer,](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html) is still available on the NYT website and amazingly hardly feels dated 12 years after it was published. It is interesting to compare DFW's account of Federer, earlier in his career, with an [interview the great Swiss champion gave last night to John McEnroe on ESPN](https://www.express.co.uk/sport/tennis/1010019/Roger-Federer-US-Open-tennis-schedule-2018-John-McEnroe). Another passage: from lion in springtime to lion in autumn!
