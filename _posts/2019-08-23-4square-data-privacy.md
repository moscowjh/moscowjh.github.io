Dennis Crowley, the founder of Foursquare, said some interesting things to journalist Peter Kafka on the [August 21, 2109 Recode Media podcast](https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmZlZWRidXJuZXIuY29tL1JlY29kZS1NZWRpYQ%3D%3D). He spoke about giving up the CEO job at his company, about Foursquare surviving for over ten years (and living through different cycles of hype), about running a true tech (as opposed to a tech media) company in New York, and about owning a minor league soccer team. Mostly, though, he talked about data privacy.

Foursquare is a company that is all about location technologies and data. It's best-known product launched about a decade ago, enables people to "check-in" to places using their smartphones. The company long ago stopped focusing on its consumer apps and, instead, makes money selling "location services" to large corporations (mainly).

Although Foursquare's services are derived from some of the same kinds of data that Facebook and Google have been accused of abusing, Crowley is quick to assert that his company is much more "open and transparent" than the tech giants about what it does with data. He has even become something of a spokesperson on [data privacy best practices](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/9/18257541/foursquare-dennis-crowley-data-collection-facebook-google-regulation-sxsw-2019). With a Google search, you can find a number of commentators who agree with Crowley's assertions.

Coincidentally (or maybe not), Foursquare published new versions of its Usage and Privacy policies about which I was notified on my phone this morning. I took a few minutes to look at the Usage policy and quickly realized that to understand what these documents (and the changes to them) meant, I would need to devote 30 minutes and that it would be more comfortable to look at the documents on a computer or to print them out.

I may examine these documents as part of this writing project on data and privacy, but as a matter of course I rarely even skim the legal documents that we all agree to when we use software. And if I don't read the documents then very few ordinary people do. These policy documents govern what the online services can do with your data and what, if any, rights you have to that data.

It has become pretty clear to me that the balance between business's increasing and insatiable "need to know" customer data and the individual's right to privacy and to control what data s/he releases to third-parties is the central policy debate affecting technological businesses economy today. This encourages me to continue writing about the topic in this blog.
