title:  "Weekend Reading: Why Doctors Hate Their Computers"
---

Atul Gawande is required reading (and has been for years) for anyone interested in medicine. His most recent New Yorker essay(https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/12/why-doctors-hate-their-computers) is definitely a must read for anyone interested in the failure of technology to reduce costs in the US medical system. The piece starts with an account of Gawande's personal experience at his hospital with "upgrading" from an older in-house computer system to Epic, one of the most commonly used Electronic Medical Records in the US. The outcome, at least in the immediate term, is much more work for doctors and an epidemic of burn-out in the medical profession. Gawande probes the issue deeply with great delicacy. He explores it from the perspective of a couple of other doctors and also of one of his own patients.  Great article - really a must read!
