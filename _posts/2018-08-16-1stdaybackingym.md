Today marked my return to the gym for the first time since July 12. Previous workout of any kind was tennis with Doug S on Sunday, July 15. My calf muscle 'popped' during that match. Then, six days later, on July 21, I had an emergency appendectomy. It has been a slow recovery ever since. Have a lot of ground to make up, but it's going to continue at a measured pace.  Good luck and good health!
