Since completing the Udacity data analytics curriculum, I have been brainstorming next steps in continuing education.  Given my current interests, that means learning more math/statistics, computer technologies or using existing skills to build projects and learn more about different subject areas. Here's the list I have compiled so far:

- Baseball statistics with R (book)
- Machine Learning (book - recommended by Misha)
- Data Camp (online learning resource for Python, R and SQL)
- Udacity (further learning in Machine Learning or Data Science)
- Nature of Code (book) and learning the Processing(.py) framework.
- Linear Algebra and Calculus using Khan Academy
- Udemy courses in SQL, Python and statistics
- D3.js - javascript library for displaying data (using freecodecamp.org)

This list of possibilities is not short, so the task is going to be identifying the most productive and fun learning areas, creating a logical sequence, and de-prioritizing the rest.
