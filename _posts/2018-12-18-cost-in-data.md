We have reached the season of "best-of-2018" lists in all forms of media. *The Wall Street Journal* recently ran a piece on their best data graphics for 2018. I particularly liked [this April report, which showed the reader all the kinds of data that a pair of friends could potentially give up on a pizza and movie night](https://www.wsj.com/graphics/how-pizza-night-can-cost-more-in-data-than-dollars/).

There is nothing complex about these graphics either in terms of the underlying math or the visualization itself. But since people don't usually think in a detailed or specific way about data privacy, it is devastatingly effective. Because the *WSJ* paywall often makes it difficult to share items, I am posting a couple of screenshots so the reader can follow without actually having access to the *WSJ*.

The body of article consists of an analysis of each part of the friends' evening, the online sources they consult, and the personal data which is shared in each step.  For instance, during the drive over to her friend's house, the other individual does the following.

Following several subsections of this nature, there is a summary that appears as follows.

So, not only do the friends provide 53 items of personal data to some combination of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, but the privacy policies that disclose the companies' access to the data total **76,069** words. To quote the article,

> At an average reading speed of 250 words a minute, it would take someone more than **five hours** to read all the policies reviewed for [the scenario]

Obviously, no normal Amazon, Apple, Facebook or Google user is going to spend five hours to read privacy policies, let alone the fact that in many cases there is no real option to decline them.

In a nutshell, this is the problem that the US faces in dealing with the giant internet companies. The companies not only have no incentive to protect user privacy, but their business models are designed around minimizing it.
