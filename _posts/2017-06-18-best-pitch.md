title:  "My Best Pitch"
---

While waiting to go for a run on Friday, my friend Mark called out of the blue. Turned out that he was driving on the NYS Thruway from the city to Albany so he could attend his son’s tennis competition. It was late enough on Friday evening that he was thinking of people on the West Coast whom he could call to chat since it was still late afternoon here.

Mark is someone I have known since 6th or 7th grade. We were not close friends in school, but we had one thing in common: both of us played tennis. Not that it mean we had very much in common: Mark was the best player at our school and one of the top junior players in the DC area. He went on to play #1 singles for his college, attempted to break into pro tennis, eventually went to business school and has become a successful corporate sales executive.

After talking for a while about mutual friends, Mark started to ask questions about Seattle. I related that I have settled in and that I feel comfortable with people I have met here, but have not yet identified full-time work.  Mark asked me what my pitch to businesses here is: I gave him a version of it with some verbal stumbles.

Mark’s response was that one of my strengths are the well-known brands for whom I have worked. He then gave me an off-the-cuff version which included mentioning Sun, HP, Scholastic and MSG. That is a point that has been made before and I need a smooth pitch that includes those names.  Lesson learned.
