I [posted not long ago about crypto/blockchain startups](https://moscowjh.github.io/2018/10/22/crypto_blockchain.html) and alluded to my consulting work in that sector. Now, the company I consulted with is in the news - and not in a good way.

The defacto CEO of the start-up turns out not to have been 'Shaun MacDonald,' but rather Boaz Manor, a Canadian financier who served jail time and received a lifetime ban from the securities industry for fraud in a hedge fund he managed about a decade ago. [A thorough report on the crypto news website "The Block," alleges](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2018/12/10/two-identities-one-man-the-story-of-800-million-hedge-fund-fraudster-boaz-manor-who-led-the-alleged-31-million-blockchain-terminal-ico/) that MacDonald misrepresented himself and the company to investors in the company's Initial Coin Offering (ICO) last spring and defrauded them of some or all of the $31 million the ICO purportedly raised.

My consulting engagement was brief and tangential to the ICO. In my brief visit to its NYC headquarters, it was evident that the company was burning through cash. However, the same could be said about most funded start-ups I have encountered. Actually, what is surprising to me about the news report is not that fraudsters, in general, would be attracted to crypto blockchain sector - because that stands to reason.

What is most surprising, if the allegations prove to be true, is that the company's business proposition was a really solid one. It proposed to create a suite of tools that would make cryptocurrencies a more comfortable fit for established financial services companies. The flashiest of these tools was the Blockchain Terminal, a Bloomberg box for crypto traders. There was also going to be software that would ensure that crypto trades would be handled in accordance with compliance regulations, and integrations with other third-party financial software tools.

In fact, in online discussion groups, some traders and investors have defended the product prototypes they received. It also seems that some of the individuals who worked there have moved to other companies trying to create similar tools, an endorsement of the basic business thesis. And I can observe from my brief engagement that these ideas and the company's dynamism were powerful enough to have attracted a number of very smart technologists to work there.

If the fraud allegations prove to be true, it really begs the question "why on this project?" It seems to me that the venture had a real chance of success and if it had been successful, would have been worth a lot more than $31 million!
