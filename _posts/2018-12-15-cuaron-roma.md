I went to see the movie *Roma* Friday evening at Cinerama. The film was released on Netflix the same day, but I really wanted to see the cinematography on the big screen. There's a lot to say about the movie, its direction, and performances, but this is not the right time, nor am I in the right frame of mind for a film review. It's one of those films that is as deep as an excellent novel, but which also makes maximal use of the visual and auditory aspects of cinema. I have been a fan of Alfonso Cuaron for many years, since his independent debut, *Y Tu Mama Tambien*.  His last blockbuster, *Gravity*, was beautiul and haunting in its own way. Here is the trailer for *Roma*:
