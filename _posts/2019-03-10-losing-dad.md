My father died on March 2, six weeks after suffering a stroke. He was 88 years old. He and my mother were visiting my brother and his family in California when he was stricken. Initially, we hoped that he would recover and be able to live with some degree of independence with my Mom. They were married for 56 years.

Until this final medical episode Dad had never, to our knowledge, spent a night in a hospital. He worked into his mid-80s, played tennis until about the same time, and even in his final years, exercised every day. He remained in contact with former colleagues, attended many seminars and presentations about foreign policy and China that are available in DC.  He and my Mom considered moving to assisted living either in DC or in California, but opted to remain in their apartment in the Cleveland Park section of DC.

The major undertaking of Dad's last year was to support my Mom through hip replacement surgery. She had been in pain and had been losing mobility for a couple years, but was reluctant to accept medical advice to get the hip replaced. Dad deployed his full array of diplomatic skills to encourage her and when she did decide to proceed, drove her to every medical appointment and was there with her at Sibley Hospital early in the morning of her surgery. The surgery was a great success, Mom was on her feet again almost immediately and Dad, again, accompanied her to every appointment, encouraged her in her follow-up therapy and remained vigilant about her health long after Mom declared herself "fixed."

This is evidence of compassion and of love for Lenore.

My brother and I both noticed that the "job" of caring for Mom, reenergized Dad. He was healthy until the last weeks of his life, but we noticed over the last few years that he had lost some energy and some mental acuity. He spoke with both of us about the prospect of giving up driving in the near future.

My parents were known for celebrating all of their milestones together. A number of those dates happen to fall in the holiday season - at the end of last year, they celebrated Mom's birthday together, then New Year, and on January 6, they celebrated 56 years of marriage. A couple days later they got on the plane to visit my brother, wife and their beloved grandson, Leo, in Pasadena.

Herb Horowitz had a long and distinguished life. He made a great impression on many colleagues - older, peers and younger. The story I am telling here is that he aged with dignity and grace, enjoyed good health until the very end, and departed rather quickly.
