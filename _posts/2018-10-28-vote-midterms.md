title:  "Vote!"
---
In a few separate conversations with young adults, I was surprised to learn that **none** of the five people with whom I conversed planned to vote in the upcoming midterm elections. This was surprising to me because one of these people is my son and the other four were engaged in a conversation where everyone was bemoaning the policies of the 45th President of the United States. Almost all of these people had moved recently, so one reason they aren't voting is because it isn't easy to quickly change your registration after moving.  But in truth, no one had made it a priority. Everyone! You can complain all you want, but if you do not go and exercise your right to vote, you really then have not earned the right to complain about the outcome of the election.
