title:  "Vote!"
---
In a few recent conversations with young adults, I was surprised to learn that **none** of the five people with whom I conversed planned to vote in the upcoming midterm elections. This was surprising to me even though it should not have been because [US voter turnout among younger voters has been low for a long time](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/18/17585898/young-voter-turnout-polls-midterms-2018).  It displeased me because one of the young adults is my son and the other four were engaged in a conversation where everyone was bemoaning the policies of the 45th President of the United States.

Almost all of these people had relocated recently, so one reason they are not voting is because it is not straightforward to quickly change your registration after moving. That is true even in Washington state, where I live now, and even more true in the southern US where my son now lives. But in truth, no one had made it a priority.

Everyone, you can talk all you want about the shortcomings of the President, but if you do not go and exercise your right to vote, you really then have not earned the right to complain about the outcome of the elections!
