title:  "City Ladder"

Have spent a few hours per week over the past six weeks working on the City Ladder Co e-commerce site.  CLC has been an appealing client in a contrarian way.  It’s a business-to-business vendor of ladders and scaffolds to the construction trades. Typical clients include contractors and building maintenance organizations. The primary products are Werner ladders - probably the leading brand in the category for the US.  Ladders are not an optimal item for e-commerce because of their size and weight i.e., you can’t send them via UPS or FedEx. Nevertheless, having a website and e-commerce capability has revitalized my client’s business over the past couple years. The business has a delivery truck and so local deliveries - within about a 40-mile range - can be done economically.

My client’s wife, who also worked in the business, passed away very suddenly about six weeks ago.  She was in her only in her mid-50s with a heart condition.  Steve had already been struggling with some decisions about the digital side of his business.  It’s not that he doesn’t appreciate growth, from whatever source, but some of the things a business owner confronts in a digital business are just very different  from in the “bricks and mortar” world.  Funny, I had not thought about it much before but that term “bricks and mortar” is probably particularly applicable to a business which services construction work.

A couple weeks after the woman’s death, the distributor who had introduced me to the business approached me. Together we decided to proceed with some minor additions to the online inventory and changes to the site.  Her husband appears to be grateful for our initiative and is willing to pay me for my time. There was a meeting yesterday with Werner ladder’s e-commerce staff who had some suggestions about how to improve our conversions. It will be interesting to see whether online sales becomes a bigger part of this business.
