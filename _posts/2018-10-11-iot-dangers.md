title:  "Internet of Things Will Be a Huge Cybersecurity Disaster Unless Regulated"
---

Today's *New York Times* includes a column by the tech reporter Farhad Manjoo under the headline ["A Future Where Everything Becomes a Computer Is as Creepy as You Feared"](https://nyti.ms/2A3ROIt). It's a good column which raises a  valid point about the "internet of things" (IoT - in industry jargon) - the idea that sooner rather than later almost every ordinary appliance or tool will be connected to the internet.

The article cites Bruce Schneier, one of the leading experts in the field of cybersecurity that "putting a computer in everything turns the whole world into a computer security threat." And that the only way to mitigate that threat is through government regulation of IoT. "I can think of no industry in the past 100 years that has improved its safety and security without being compelled to do so by government," Schneier has written.

The article is undermined somewhat by its headline which is not specific or clear enough about the subject. The title of this post is what I think the headline should be! The argument is also weakened by an untruth which is Manjoo's assertion that IoT is a "new thing." Sun Microsystems was the first major corporation to talk about everything eventually having its own IP address - 20+ years ago.  The *Times* reporting on tech is sloppy: sometimes it misreports items and not infrequently they miss important trends or moments entirely. But this article's key point is correct, important, and should be heeded.
