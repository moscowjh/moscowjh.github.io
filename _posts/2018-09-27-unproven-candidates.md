title:  "Hire People Who Aren't Proven"

Strongly agree with the following line of thought:

> Most jobs positions out there regarding the job role go like this "10 years experience in job role, proven experience in whatever the responsibilities are, high proficiency in infinite technology set, already built successful whatever, ability to work well in a team, exceptional references from previous companies"

> When I read such things, here's what I read instead: "We're looking for a candidate who is: at least a one time World Cup Champion, two times FIFA World Cup awards winner, best scorer of the season, proven ability to work well in a team, exceptional references from previous teams".

Though [this particular blog post](https://leonardofed.io/blog/startups-hiring.html) is focused on start-up hiring, it seems to me that it applies to job postings from more standard corporate or non-profit employers. Companies complain about not being able to fill positions, but hiring processes are still calibrated for the post-recession job market of 2008-2014.

On a side note, this item comes from a pretty obscure source and was surfaced by Hacker News which really is a great discovery mechanism for tech related writing.
