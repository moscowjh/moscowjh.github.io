title:  "Laughing at Yourself"
---
To maintain sanity, it's absolutely essential to be able to laugh!  You can laugh at good jokes, at the absurdities of life, and, above all, you have to be able to laugh at oneself.  None of us are as great as we would like to be and usually inflate our own self-importance. So here goes!

I went to my college alumni association's summer bbq yesterday. A couple days earlier I had purchased an inexpensive pair of shorts in our school colors expressly to wear at the event. In the morning, I even ironed the shorts!  I arrived at the venue at about 1pm and saw that almost everyone else was already eating. I strolled over to the grill and requested a burger. I then took a hot dog from the chafing dish and piled my plate hight with lettuce, pickles, salads, etc.  The cook brought me my burger. Holding  my plate, I pointed a bottle of ketchup and squeezed it. The stream of ketchup connected directly with my left short leg (none of it reached my plate)! I couldn't have done it better if I had tried: it was spot on. I had been there for fewer than ten minutes at the time and no quantity of water or wet wipes was able to change my appearance for the next four hours!
