"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor" is one of the ten commandments. I am not religious so I do not often spend time reflecting on scriptures or commandments. Recently, someone very close to me was arrested and imprisoned briefly on account of false testimony made by her sister to the local police department.

One of the things I have been thinking about is the difference between ordinary lying and perjury. Ordinary lying is not a good thing, but it is something most of us live with in our daily lives. We all know people who habitually exaggerate to the point of lying and, either because of their importance to our lives or because they are completely tangential, we roll our eyes and more or less ignore these untruths. Also, most of us, at one point or another, have told "white" lies to make some situation easier and most of us, myself included, don't feel at all guilty or give the "white" lies a second thought.

Bearing false witness (legal term - perjury) is a different matter entirely than lying. Telling untruth to authorities, accusing others of crimes they did not commit is a very serious thing which, I see now, is why it is elevated to being a biblical commandment. Once the state formally enters a legal complaint against a person, her reputation is stained (regardless of 'innocent until proven guilty'). One hopes that truth will win in the end, but until it actually does win, you aren't really sure.

Another item to process is what to do about the family member who violated the commandment. It is tempting to be angry and vengeful: real damage has been done both to the sister and, more critically, to their elderly mother. The perjurer has a reputation among family and family friends as being petty and overly concerned with status/wealth.  Nevertheless, she is family member and at some point it will be necessary for all the siblings to rally to their mother's side. As long as we are thinking biblically, there is the also the injunction to "turn the other cheek" which, in my experience, is sometimes the right way to behave. I don't really have an answer to this one - it's something I will continue to ponder.

Truthfulness and integrity are, among other things, habits. One important take away from these reflections is that ignoring "white" lies and similar things make a person numb to the importance of always telling the truth. When you get in the habit of ignoring little daily lies, it is difficult to exercise correct judgement and perspective under pressure when an opportunity to bear false witness presents itself. This is not an excuse for bad behavior, but a way for me to understand what has happened.
