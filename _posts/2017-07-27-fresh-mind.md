title:  "Daily Practice: First Things"
---
Am getting better at understanding that certain things only get done if they are approached with a fresh, rested mind. Creating a new resume draft or a document for a headhunter is a little dry, requires a sales mindset, and generally will not get accomplished if it is the seventh or eighth item on my daily to-do list. Some other items like daily foreign language practice or 10 minutes of meditation are easier to squeeze in later, but truthfully are sloppier if they are done later in the day. Have been leaving coding practice to the evening and, as a result, have been doing relatively little of it. Early morning exercise is not easy for me, but I recognize that if I do my CrossFit at 9am, it has been conquered. If I leave it to the evening, it's more of a 50/50 thing. However, later in the day, sitting at my desk, I am tired.
