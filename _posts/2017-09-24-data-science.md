title:  "Data Science"
---
I recently started a online continuing-ed program in data science. Previously, I had done a significant portion of a similar program in web development. I considered completing that program, which would require less time and lead to potentially equally as many employment opportunities. For a number of reasons, figuring out data seems very important and compelling.

Max unintentionally articulated the reason why when I described to him the structure of the program and the nature of the first assignment. We were talking about the difference between learning a technology like Python for data science vs. learning the same tool for software engineering. He said, software engineers don't have to explain why they are taking a certain approach to an end user, but a data scientist is always seeking to explain her findings in plain English.

My motivations about technology - in all my professional and personal roles - are similarly much more about explaining or applying technology to "real life."  I realized that I am not, as many of my friends with engineering education are, all about building things or finding a better way to do x (thought I have a bit of that too). For me, data science is not only about making myself more appealing on the contemporary job market, but potentially can facilitate longer term goals about research and/or writing projects.
