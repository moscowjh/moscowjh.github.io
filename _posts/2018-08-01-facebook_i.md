title:  "Facebook - Personal Observations I"
---

Like a lot of people, I have been thinking a lot about Facebook recently. The company
was so lax with its users' data privacy and favored advertisers to such a degree,
that unscrupulous actors (including the Russian government) were able to use it to
undermine democracy. When confronted with these lapses Facebook has admitted 'some'
wrongdoing, but event these admissions have been tone deaf.

When I first heard Mark Zuckerberg speak about the site in 2006, it was one of my
most notable "why didn't I have that idea!!" moments.  The idea of on online version
of the paper "facebook" I received as a college freshman was intuitively powerful.

I didn't join until the next year, 2007, and at first used it mainly to experiment
with my online persona and connected with tech industry colleagues. By the beginning
of the great recession, like many, I was looking for work and FB filled the void of
not having in-person colleagues.  It had tremendous powerat connecting me with
geographically dispersed friends and former colleagues across many timezones.

That power is largely what keeps me on FB to this day, though I barely maintain
or update my profile. If I were to delete my FB account, I would lose contact with
a decently large number of real friends.

Before FB went public in 2012, many in the press raised the question of what the
site could do to justify the huge valuations that were bandied about by investors.
If I remember correctly the company had just introduced advertising (or maybe it
hadn't yet). It was sufficiently clear to me even in 2012, that FB had enough users,
growth and stickiness to figure out a profitable business model. Shortly after the
IPO, I purchased a small number of shares on one of the 'dips' in its price. I held
those shares until this spring, after the Cambridge Analytica data leakage was made
public.
