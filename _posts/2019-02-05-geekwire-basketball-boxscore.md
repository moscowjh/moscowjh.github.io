One new podcast I have been enjoying recently is [*Numbers Geek*, a production of the Seattle news media company Geekwire which features former Microsoft CEO, and current Los Angeles Clippers (NBA) owner, Steve Ballmer.](https://www.geekwire.com/numbersgeek/)

Ballmer is famously loud and gregarious. He loves numbers. One of his current endeavors is [USA Facts](https://usafacts.org), a non-profit he started to help make government more transparent and to inspire positive civic dialogue about public spending. The breadth of Ballmer's experience and his intensity make for podcast episodes that are both informative and entertaining.

I loved [the episode in which Geekwire host, Todd Bishop, had Ballmer examine a basketball boxscore.](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/numbers-geek-steve-ballmer-basketball-box-score-mystery/) All of the personally identifiable information was stripped from box score: Bishop asked Ballmer to guess which specific game the box score came from. Ballmer scanned through the different statistics and started to deduce things about the game. For instance, from the amount of playing time allocated to different positions, he correctly guessed that it was from a playoff game.

A number of recorded interview segments shed light on how various basketball experts view game stats.  Steve Kerry, Coach of the current NBA Champions, was characteristically incisive:

> When I get the stats sheets at the end of each game, I look at three numbers: I look at our assists, our turnovers and our defensive field goal percentage allowed. Those three numbers usually tell me whether we won or lost.

The box score was from Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals, the final game of Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls' career, in which he hit a buzzer-beating jump shot to defeat the great Utah Jazz.
