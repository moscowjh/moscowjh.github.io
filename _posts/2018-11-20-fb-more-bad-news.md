title:  "More Bad Behavior by Facebook, Inc."
---
[Back in August, I mused about Facebook's transgressions](https://moscowjh.github.io/2018/08/01/facebook.html) in the context of my own long experience as a FB user. Last week the [*New York Times* published a detailed expose](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html) on the company's reaction to its realization that the social platform had been manipulated during the 2016 election cycle. Revelations that emerge from the report include:
- groups within Facebook's security team were aware of Russian hacking during the 2016 US electoral campaign;
- Facebook's Chief Security officer getting reamed by COO Sheryl Sandberg for disclosing information about Russian hacks to the company's Board;
- FB launching a PR campaign directed against other large tech companies (including Apple and Google) to divert attention from its own abuse of users' privacy.

There has been much subsequent commentary on the importance of these revelations including some questioning [the intrinsic value](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/opinion/facebook-zuckerberg-investigation-election.html) of information technology and [calls for regulation of the social network](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/opinion/facebook-data-congress-russia-election.html).

What is clear to me from reading the *Times'* investigation is that, like the Sorcerer's apprentice, Facebook's founders never truly understood the power of their invention. When they hired "adult supervision" such as the COO, Sheryl Sandberg, they engaged people who were aggressive and good at sales, but lacked the wisdom to play the role of the old sorcerer (from Goethe's poem and its 20th century adaptation, Disney's *Fantasia*) who returns and is able to control the spell unleashed by the apprentice. Given the tremendous power of social networks, Facebook's in particular, it is now up to the state to mandate fundamental reform in the way these technologies work for society's benefit.
