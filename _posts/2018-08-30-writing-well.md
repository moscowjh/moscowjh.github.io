title:  "On Writing Well"
---
This week I listened to an interview with the founder/owner of a prominent tech company. It was surprising to hear him say that of all the qualities he demands of successful job seekers at the company, first and foremost is clear and persuasive writing.  A part of his argument was that in a business where most interactions between people take place via technologies such as email, online messaging and social networking, the ability to write well is more important than ever.  He even said that for technology specialists including developers, inability to write persuasively would be a deal killer. This is a very unusual thing for a tech entrepreneur to say, but I believe that it is correct.
