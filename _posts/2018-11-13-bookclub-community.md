title:  "Computer Science Book Club - Building Community"
---
Back in August, I posted about the [Computer Science book club](https://moscowjh.github.io/2018/08/21/cs-bookclub.html) that I recently took over after its founder found himself too busy for it. In that post, I focused on the topics that I would want to cover. The post reads like a draft for a class syllabus. Tonight is the club's second meeting since I started running it: for the first few meetings I selected books that I mentioned in that earlier post.

What I have learned in the interim is that as I took over the facilitator role, I forgot to ask the most important questions. Is there a community? What does it want to read? How often is it willing to meet. Instead, I focused on the logistics of selecting books and communicating that list to the store that hosts the meetings. Since the club had existed for over a year and since it had an associated Facebook group with over 60 members, I assumed that there was a group of people who enjoyed reading on this topic and also enjoyed getting together.

It turned out that despite various announcements over social media and through the bookstore, no one beside me turned up for the first meeting. Tonight is the second meeting and I am hoping that some adjustments we made in the communications will yield one or two other readers. I did not understand that I was effectively starting the club over again. It seems to me that the essential ingredient for a bookclub is two or more readers: that seems to be the right place to start.
