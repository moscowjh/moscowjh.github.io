I have been a little surprised by a point that is being made in the press about Apple's current problems with its iPhone XR. For those who don't follow mobile tech all that closely, the XR is the new model iPhone which sells for a couple of hundred dollars less than the XS and XS Plus, the current leading-edge iPhones. The fact that the XR has not been selling as well as forecast, particularly in China, is cited as one of the major reasons that the company had to revise its revenue forecast by $5 billion.

*The Wall Street Journal's* personal tech correspondent, Joanna Stern calls the XR:
> The just-right Goldilocks phone that is still the best iPhone for the majority of Apple's customers.

She goes on to praise the phone's battery life and availability in multiple colors, saying "I haven't been this content with an iPhone in years."

Stern [spins three theories for why the XR isn't selling well and those theories contain truth, but the explanation is actually even simpler](https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-xr-revisited-the-best-iphone-apple-cant-sell-11546886742).

1. Apple has continued to sell models from the previous two years which are cheaper than the XR and are perfectly capable of running the latest iOS software. Also, seven is too large for the number of models on sale at one time. One of the first thing Steve Jobs did when he returned to Apple in 1997 was to simplify Apple's product lines and to reduce the number of models on sale.
2. Professional reviewers like Stern are underestimating the importance of the camera in the non-techie's phone purchase. The XS has a double lens camera which enables better zoom and portrait photos than the XR's single lens camera. The Plus versions of older phones also have the double lens configuration. For many people, a smartphone is now their only camera. If you buy a phone every 3-4 years, spending an extra $150 for the better camera is worth it.
3. Premium smartphones are getting more expensive, durable, and carrier subsidies have all but disappeared so people are keeping their phones for longer on average.

I personally think the beating that Apple stock has taken is overdone. Apple still has many strengths as a company: the elegance, integration and ease-of-use of its software platforms makes users (including me) much more productive. It is also the only one of the major tech companies that has made protecting user privacy as central part of its business. The head start it has on other major tech companies in the wearables market (because of the Apple Watch) gives it some advantages in developing other types of products. But what we haven't seen from Apple in a while is real hardware innovation of the type that used to be a regular thing during Jobs' lifetime. Fair or not, that's what people look for Apple to do and its longevity at the top end of the market cap rankings will probably depend on it continuing to innovate in this way.
