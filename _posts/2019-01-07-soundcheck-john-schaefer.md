Normally on Mondays this space is occupied with a discussion of something I read over the weekend. This past weekend, I read less than usual largely because I spent my time watching NFL playoff football and NBA basketball. So, instead, I want to present one of my favorite regular 'listens,' the Soundcheck podcast produced and hosted by music journalist, John Schaefer.

Soundcheck is one program within Schaefer's broader work, New Sounds. I have listened to it for many years because not only because it enables the discovery of new artists and works, but also because Schaefer is such a strong and perceptive interviewer. Reading through the staff list on the New Sounds website, it seems that almost every person involved in producing its shows is a musician. Not sure if this is the reason for the depth of the performances and interviews, but that is my working hypothesis.

Until a few years ago, Soundcheck was a daily live program on the WNYC radio station.  When the station removed the on-air version, I was upset enough to write in with a protest.  For a while, the current new media version of the program appeared only occasionally and I figured that WNYC had killed Soundcheck. However, over the past couple years, Soundcheck has revived with almost weekly in-studio performances/interviews many of which are webcast live and all of which get distributed in podcast form. So kudos to Schaefer and the New Sounds team for their perseverance in crossing the divide from traditional broadcast media.

This post was inspired by two recent "best of 2018" episodes which can be found on the usual podcast platforms and on the [show's website](https://www.newsounds.org/shows/soundcheck). However, you can dip into the episodes at almost any point and you will learn a lot and enjoy exposure to 'new sounds.'

As a bonus, here is a video taken from a July 2018 Soundcheck performance by the great British folk/jazz singer, Joan Armatrading:
