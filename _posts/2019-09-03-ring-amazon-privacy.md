Pushing my shopping cart through CostCo last week, the large number of doorbell and household security cameras made an impression. These devices have been around for a while, but the technology has become less expensive and internet connectivity has made it easier to access footage shot by the cameras. I reflexively started to ask myself whether such a purchase would make sense to me and very quickly decided, "no."

The *Washington Post* broke news, also last week, that [Amazon has established partnerships with over 400 law enforcement agencies in the US to make it easier for the authorities to obtain video footage from doorbell cameras](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/28/doorbell-camera-firm-ring-has-partnered-with-police-forces-extending-surveillance-reach/) marketed by Ring, a company Amazon acquired last year.

The article raises a number of privacy and related questions:
- does the fact that Ring/Amazon are making it easier for law enforcement to obtain surveillance video (though not requiring any customer to share footage) constitute an abuse of civil liberties?
- does the additional data in Amazon's hands in addition to what they already have on our shopping habits make for too much concentration of power?
- should the acquisition of Ring in 2018 for $853 million have been approved by US regulators or is this another example of concentration of market power overlooked by the authorities (as with Facebook's 2012 acquisition of Instagram).

To all of these questions, there are arguments that could be made either way, but the position held by most of the constitutional and privacy experts interviewed for the article goes against Amazon's positions. As a private citizen who believes that civil liberties and public safety are both important things, I am concerned.

Kudos to the *Post* owned by Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, for breaking the story and not pulling any punches.
