title:  "Have We Hit Peak Social?"
---
Coincidentally, after completing the previous post, I saw the following headline in the New York Times:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Snap, the maker of the Snapchat app, said it lost 3 million daily active users in the second quarter from earlier this year. It was the first time since the company went public that it had reported a decline in users. <a href="https://t.co/1tesJJZZ1F">https://t.co/1tesJJZZ1F</a></p>&mdash; The New York Times (@nytimes) <a href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1027012054182494208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2018</a></blockquote>

There are a number of ways to understand the point (which is being repeated in multiple places in the tech media).  If the question is whether the current set of large, advertising-driven social media companies have hit the peak of their growth as measured either by users or advertising revenue, the answer is "yes, maybe." Certainly these numbers are showing that the addressable market (mainly in the developed economies) has reached a point where issues that have been raised by the 2016 US elections, by the corporations' blatant disregard for user privacy, and by the growing understanding that many of us are spending far too much of our time absorbed by our screens.  That may be a lasting constraint on growth for Facebook, Twitter, Snap, etc.

However, I personally do not believe that the world has hit 'peak social' in terms of the benefits that accrue from connectivity among different geographies, dispersed networks of friends/family, professional networking, remote workplaces, etc. I think that people will continue to increase the activities that benefit them in various ways and that the marketplace will evolve away from current giants like Facebook.  The solutions to the issues plaguing the current social networking giants may already exist and be obvious to entrepreneurs.  Time will tell.
