title:  "Weekend Reading: Double Dip"
---
Lots of consequential news this weekend including various things going on at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires. Here in the US, the death of former President George H.W. Bush overshadowed these current events. Obituaries are often very interesting, but [the *New York Times'* long obit](https://nyti.ms/2DU2iwe) of Bush written by the powerhouse political reporter, Adam Nagourney, was unusually complete and thoughtful.

Another excellent *NYT* report from the Sunday Magazine was this [long piece on the decline in the number and diversity of insects](https://nyti.ms/2DMT70v), whether that is an indicator of climate change and what it portends for the future of biodiversity. It is very worth making the time effort to read about the "Insect Apocalypse."
