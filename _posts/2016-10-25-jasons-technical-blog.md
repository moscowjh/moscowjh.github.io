title:  "Welcome to Jason's Development Blog!"

This is the first post of Jason's technical blog.

We'll be documenting a number of things here:
- I'll be learning how to create, manage and deploy a static website using the Jekyll framework. Initially, this site is going to live on my own development laptop, but in fairly short order the plan is to post it to Amazon Web Services in order to start getting hands-on experience with cloud deployments.
- My adventures learning Web Development technologies including Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Postgres and other things that will be described later.
- Personal transition happening this winter of 2016-17 including the end of a 25-year marriage and my likely move to Seattle.

Let's give this a whirl!
