title:  "Anniversaries and History"
---
Today is the 17th anniversary of 9/11. I have yet to find adequate language to describe my experience of that day. Unlike many of our neighbors in Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan, we were very fortunate: none my family members were harmed either in the attack itself or in the conflicts that came later.

We did experience 9/11 very personally: suffering through the trauma and the post-traumatic stress experienced by New Yorkers at that time. I surfaced on the street just north of the World Trade Center a few minutes after the planes hit the Towers. My company's offices were on the 24th and 25th floor of the South Tower and at the time of the attack, I was in the subway on my way to work.  I walked back home to Brooklyn where my kids were in elementary school. My wife had to walk a full 8-10 miles from mid-town to get home. We felt tremendous shock after the towers fell and grief as it became clear that none of the people on the ubiquitous "Missing" flyers would ever come home again.

The 9/11 anniversary will always feel significant to me. The first few  years, it almost felt like a memorial service for loved ones. As time passes, that feeling has muted, but there is still a dull ache. It's really interesting to see how the remembrances change over time - like early drafts of history that are constantly being revised. Today's *New York Times* carried an op-ed by a veteran who had joined the military after his brother was killed on 9/11 and lived through multiple deployments to Afghanistan.

> I went to war to avenge my brotherâ€™s death. But the only person I truly wanted to kill died 17 years ago. ["The Real Lesson of 9/11" by Joe Quinn](https://nyti.ms/2N7cg3m)

I am sure that many people will disagree with Quinn's opinion, but he makes a forceful case and he puts it into historical context.

Another anniversary was noted this week: the 10th anniversary of the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers which was a milestone in the unfolding of the economic crisis. There have been fewer attempts to put 2008 into historical perspective than 9/11 - at first because it was too recent then later, until recently actually, it felt as though we were still experiencing the after-effects of the recession.  The *NYT's* Andrew Ross Sorkin, made a wonderful attempt at providing missing context in an article entitled ["From Trump to Trade, the Financial Crisis Still Resonates 10 Years Later"](https://nyti.ms/2N3I9d2)

> The crisis was a moment that cleaved our country. It broke a social contract between the plutocrats and everyone else. But it also broke a sense of trust, not just in financial institutions and the government that oversaw them, but in the very idea of experts and expertise. The past 10 years have seen an open revolt against the intelligentsia.

I suspect that both of these perspectives will stand the test of time, but I don't know for sure. Regardless, I am thankful that difficult anniversaries provide an opportunity for thoughtful people to reflect and that some of these thoughts will help the rest of us to come to terms with very tough times and bitter lessons.
