I have been traveling a lot lately to spend time with and to help different members of my family. In January, I was in Atlanta and then spent a week in Los Angeles. Right now, I am in DC, my birth city, with my mother helping to organize my parents' affairs.

My parents' apartment is located near the National Zoo, just off Connecticut Avenue, when I am emerging from sleep in the morning I can hear people walking there dogs outside the open window. This morning there was a car or truck that was playing music so loudly, I woke up suddenly thinking I had set an alarm on one of my devices. You can also hear buses and cars on the nearby avenue.

I didn't mind being woken up and the experience made me remember the distinct sounds of a few recent residences.

- in my current, Seattle apartment I am directly under the Seatac airport flight path and hear jets overhead even in the middle of the night. There are also the delivery trucks serving the coop grocery across the street and later on in the day there are birds in the courtyard (often very loud crows).
- in my previous residence on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, we were on the 14th floor and city sounds would drift up from below - I mainly remember sirens, lots of sirens.
- the Brooklyn apartment in which we lived when my kids were at home was directly adjacent to and above the Brooklyn Queens Expressway. I remember hearing the noise of the highway the day we moved in and wondering if we had made a mistake buying the apartment. It very quickly faded into an urban white noise except in the early mornings when very slowly moving trucks made a lot of very distinctive clanking.

I also remember soundscapes from stints living in Moscow, Saint Petersburg (Russia) and (briefly) in London. I'm a  too fatigued right now to describe those sounds exactly, but in my imagination they are evocative of the entire atmosphere of those cities.

I am feeling reflective and a bit nostalgic today; there isn't any real point I wanted to make here.
