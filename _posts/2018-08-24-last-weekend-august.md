title:  "Last Weekend of August"
---
This month-long blogging challenge has made me more aware that writing a daily post is a grind. It makes me admire regular bloggers even more - whether or not blogging is part of a person's gainful employment.  Since today is Friday, I'm going to allow myself an aspirational post about a day trip I hope to make soon via ferry to Vashon Island.  My vision is that one day soon I will set out on my own bicycle and encounter this famous  artwork on Vashon Island:

This weekend I'll stay closer to home and maybe do a little biking around Capitol Hill. The temperature has cooled off considerably and the wildfire smoke is much less than earlier in the week. Hope that it will stay that way! Wishing my loved ones and any imaginary readers a great weekend!
