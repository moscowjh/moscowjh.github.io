title:  "Instagram"

The big news in the US technology industry today is that Instagram's cofounders have resigned from Facebook, the company that acquired the photo-sharing service for one billion dollars in 2012, only two years after it was founded.  At the time of that acquisition, the storyline in the press was that Facebook (which itself was only 7 years old at the time) had drastically overpaid. One billion was considered preposterous money to pay for a start-up! Subsequently, Facebook has paid up to $20 billion for other, less proven companies; meanwhile, Instagram has been the fastest growing part of Facebook and appeals to the demographic most coveted by online advertisers. Accordingly, though perhaps meaninglessly, Instagram has been 'valued' at over $20 billion. The resignations may be indicative of the current situation at Facebook which, on the one hand, has been exerting more and more effort to squeeze revenue from its different services; and on the other hand has been under increasing public and government pressure to safeguard user privacy better than it has. It will be fascinating to see what comes next for Instagram as a Facebook service.
