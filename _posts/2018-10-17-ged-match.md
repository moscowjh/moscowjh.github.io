title:  "GED Match"
---

Astounding [article in the NYTimes on Monday](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/science/gedmatch-genealogy-cold-cases.html) and not primarily for the news that was reported. The article is about the [GED Match](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDmatch), a genealogy website and "personal genomics database."

GED Match has been in the [news this year because law enforcement has used it to identify suspects in cold cases, notably the Golden State killer](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/to-find-alleged-golden-state-killer-investigators-first-found-his-great-great-great-grandparents/2018/04/30/3c865fe7-dfcc-4a0e-b6b2-0bec548d501f_story.html?utm_term=.b3de01f0b4e2).  And the site has been mentioned in the media more recently in connection with the genetic report released by Senator Elizabeth Warren that "proved" her Native American ancestry. I'll bet she wishes that she could revisit that maneuver!

What was even more astounding than any of these news items was the fact that the website was created by a couple of really ancient dudes! This runs counter to almost every high-tech success story of the past 50 years. The business guy is 80 and the tech guy is 67.  According to the NYT profile, they sometimes engage the services of a couple other retired programmers. There are only two of them and they don't do any advertising! It's basically a hobby.

I haven't myself signed up for GED Match and also have never had my genome recorded by 23andMe or similar services. But my understanding of how genome "matching" works makes me believe that the app must have some computational sophistication. It certainly doesn't look like much: the *Times* says it "resembles an internal wiki in need of an update." But it works and is now under the media spotlight and facing growing user demand.  So kudos to Curtis Rogers and John Olson for their later-in-life success!

The broader news stories have highlighted some very interesting ethical issues around the use of these consumer-grade genomic tests. The identification of cold-case suspects has been hailed, but some have expressed discomfort with the privacy implications of giving law enforcement access to private DNA tests. Senator Warren's release of her DNA test results, meant as a response to one of President Trump's Twitter attacks on her, has been ridiculed by Trump and his supporters and also [criticized by many in the mainstream](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/opinion/elizabeth-warren-and-the-folly-of-genetic-ancestry-tests.html) who see it as descending to Trump's level. I am sure this is not the last we hear about the subject.
