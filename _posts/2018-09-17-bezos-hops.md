title:  "Weekend Reading: Bezos' Daily Routine and Fresh Hops"
---
I am generally very skeptical of that genre of digital media which can be referred to as "daily habits of the rich and famous."  While I think one can learn lots by paying attention to differences in the way people get things done, it doesn't really make sense to me to privilege the specifics of this or that celebrity eats for breakfast. So it surprises me that I enjoyed the accounts of Jeff Bezos' speech last week in Washington DC in which he highlighted [some surprisingly "normcore" habits for a billionaire](https://t.co/YtEeSB83a3):

- Sleeping eight hours per night
- Avoiding meetings before 10am
- "Puttering" in the morning, including reading a newspaper and drinking coffe
- Spending time with children.

I plead guilty to confirmation bias!

On a more recreational topic, I really enjoyed [Sunday's *Seattle Times* article about fresh hops](https://www.seattletimes.com/life/food-drink/the-wonder-of-the-fresh-hop-how-washingtons-special-autumn-beer-gets-made/) coming from the Yakima Valley in east-central Washington.  Who knew that 75% hops production in the US comes from Washington State! Though not a beer expert, I'll have to get out and try some of the fresh hops varieties. The photos that can be viewed with the article are a spectacular piece of photojournalism!
