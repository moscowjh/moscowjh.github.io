The Nats have lost two games in a row on walk-off HRs.  In yesterday's game against the Cubs, they had a 3-0 lead with two-outs and two-strikes in the bottom of the ninth. A grand slam HR by a little-known pinch-hitter put them on the wrong end of a 4-3 score. This evening, they surrendered a two-run lead to the Cardinals to trail by 6-4 going to their half of the ninth. They tie the score 6-6 and have men on first and third with one out.  Neither runner scores and in the bottom of the inning the Cards hit another HR to win it.

The Nats are fundamentally a good team. Their +70 runs-scored/runs-allowed ratio is the same as the team six games ahead of them.  They have a great lineup and some of the best starting pitchers in the game. They do have a suspect bullpen which got worse because of self-inflicted wound by management. But they are a good team.

Streaks happen. Usually things even out and a team has a chance to right itself. Sometimes it doesn't happen in a given period of time: this season appears to be a lost cause. But what can a competitor do other than prepare and compete as well as possible?
