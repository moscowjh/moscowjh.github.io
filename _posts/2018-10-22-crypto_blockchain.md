title:  "Crypto Blockchain"
---

Earlier this year, I did a consulting engagement on behalf of a New York-based startup which had prototyped a few tools to help institutional investors trade cryptocurrencies. The idea was to use blockchain technology to ensure and document compliance with SEC regulations. There was tremendous energy and passion in the company which was in the process of raising money via an ICO. Unfortunately, it was spending the money even faster than it was raising it. For me, besides a few weeks work, the engagement provided an opportunity to learn - both about the technology itself and the culture surrounding "crypto blockchain (my term for the broader field of emerging companies based on these technologies)"

One of the *New Yorker*'s best writer's, Nick Paumgarten has written an [article about the crypto blockchain world](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/22/the-prophets-of-cryptocurrency-survey-the-boom-and-bust) which feels to me like a distillation of the lessons I learned while consulting. A number of the interviews for the article were conducted at the same time as my engagement, so this is perhaps not all that surprising. Even with my fresh immersion in the field, it still wasn't all that easy for me to follow the concepts discussed by Paumgarten's main subjects. In the interest of solidifying my own understanding and also helping out confused New Yorker readers, I'm going to summarize five top takeaways from the article:

1. Very few people working in the field understand the math and computing that underly cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Understanding it at a working level requires an ability to follow metaphors layered on other metaphors.

1. To repeat, very few people understand the actual technology. Those who do - developers, mathematicians and others - form a secular priesthood. Paumgarten does an excellent job profiling some of the "high priests," namely the group that founded Ethereum.

1. Bitcoin was the original and remains the most famous cryptocurrency, but ethereum in many ways is the most interesting crypto universe. Ethereum represents a conscious attempt to create a platform for other "coins" and blockchain-based applications.

3. For the true believers in crypto blockchain, the reason the technology exists is to wrest power away from the incumbent internet giants (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google) and return it to individual users.  It is not primarily about creating alternative currencies or investment vehicles. The future internet powered by blockchain technology is referred to as the "decentralized web."  Applications that run on the decentralized web are referred to as "dapps"(decentralized applications).

4. Crypto blockchain may have started as an anarchist project, but banks and other pillars of the "financial services" establishment are currently all in. There is a crazy amount of venture capital sloshing around which is funding buildout of a needed infrastructural layer, but is also paying for some lavish lifestyles.

I will add to the last point that a number of very bright venture capitalists are  "long" on crypto blockchain, so it seems more than likely that the technology will be the basis for some important things. The timeframe in which this will happen remains unclear. I am personally am guessing more than 10 years, but it will be interesting to see if those who have bet it will happen much sooner are correct.
