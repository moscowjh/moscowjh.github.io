title:  "Early bird, night owl?"

For much of my life, I have gone back and forth between being someone who rises pre-dawn in order to get to work early or making myself sleep late enough to be alert and on top of my mental game throughout the day.

In the business of technology there are two schools of thought:
- The prevalent mindset among business executives is that high achievers wake up super early, put themselves through a vigorous physical workout while still starting work earlier than everyone else, persevere through a long workday, and avoid all but specifically work-related social obligations in order to turn in early.
- There are numerous creatives who often work late into the night (and when not working, party late too), struggle to make it in time to any meeting that starts before noon, and often don't take any physical exercise.

For much of this year, I was engaged as a consultant in the technology division of a sports/entertainment company.  I rose at 6am and arrived at work around 8 (even earlier toward the beginning of my engagement).  Some days, I went to another engagement at around 430pm and worked until 930pm. Other days, I would work out after work - at around 6pm.  After a short time, this felt natural and right for my body. I thought it would continue.

In fact, since coming off this rotation about a month ago, I have found myself waking up later and later...sometimes at around 730am, and if I work the previous evening as late as 9am.  Perhaps, this is partially the effect of shorter autumn daylight; I am sure that it is partially the absence of the 'forcing function' of 8am work.

Earlier in life, I probably would have been angry at myself for the 'slip in discipline.'  At 50+, I am able to perceive it and realize that is a phase, that I will get my work done on time, and that it's more important for me to get sufficient sleep rather than forcing myself to be up at the earlier hour.
