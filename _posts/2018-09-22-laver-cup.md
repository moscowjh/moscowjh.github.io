title:  "Weekend Sports: Laver Cup"
---
The reader has likely figured out that I spend a large amount of my spare time following and watching sports. Perhaps in a future post, I'll reflect on why I and others share this fascination, but for the moment we will just accept it.

This weekend I am paying particular attention to the Laver Cup, a tennis team competition in its second year, which is taking place in Chicago. The event pits Team Europe versus a Rest-of-World squad.  After watching a couple matches yesterday and this morning, I have concluded that the Laver Cup is really more an exhibition than a serious tennis tournament.  Again, I'm just saying it, but will not explore further at the moment.

The reason I am sharing this can be viewed in the brief video clip. During a doubles match last night, 2018 US Open Champion Novak Djokovic hit his partner, Roger Federer on the back with the ball. This is the kind of thing that happens all the time in playground or private club tennis, but that one rarely sees among the pros. It is refreshing to see the good-natured exchange between the two tennis greats after the incident.
