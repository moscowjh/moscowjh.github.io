Tomorrow is the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere. I went out looking for a data-oriented way to talk about the solstice and found a relevant graphic on the *Washington Post* website: a map by an Alaskan climatologist, Brian Brettschneider.

The data here couldn't be simpler: hours of daylight at the winter solstice at different locations in North America projected over a map of the continent. There are colored bands for each 1.5 hours of marginal daylight. Seattle, near the far northwest of the United States, is in the 8-8.5 daylight hours band. Los Angeles, where my brother and his family live, is in the 9.5-10 hours band. Angelenos are getting an extra 90 minutes of daylight more than Seattlites at this time of year! Even New York City gets 9-9.5 daylight hours: people don't think of "bright lights, big city" as referring to daylight, but it might as well.

The amount of daylight affects a human being's sense of well-being. "Seasonal affective disorder" has become a phrase that people in mainstream culture understand. When I was younger, I felt significantly more melancholy during the winter months. I still feel **differently** in winter than in summer, but would have a hard time saying whether for better or worse. I appreciate the differences between the seasons: in Seattle, it's dark and damp, but not extremely cold. Different birds and small animals are evident in the wintertime: last winter, I observed several bald eagles up close. I also appreciate the extra guilt-free study, reading and movie time that you get from having 16 hours of darkness.
