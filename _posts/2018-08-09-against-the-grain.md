title:  "Against the Grain"

In the late afternoon I was driving to meet my friend C and kids at their town beach club on Lake Washington. The route took me along Lake City Way which runs  from I-5 to the northwest shore of Lake Washington. It crosses the north Seattle street grid diagonally and, in contrast to the tony neighborhoods nearby, it features gas stations, auto dealerships, fast food and a few strip clubs. The  downscale aspect of the road appeals to me, but I also like the fact that it seems to be following the geography of the lakeshore rather than the dictate of the city planners.  It also reminds me of city roads from my past that started as country or woodland paths - Broad Branch and Brookeville Roads near Washington DC and Red Hook Lane in downtown Brooklyn.
