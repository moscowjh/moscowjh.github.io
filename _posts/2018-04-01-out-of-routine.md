title:  "Out of Routine"
---
Having been self-employed for several years, I am pretty strong when it come  creating structures for my day-to-day life.  These include regular exercise, bullet journaling, multiple checklists and a few workplaces where I keep distractions to a minimum.  I keep to a pretty regular (though not monotonous) schedule and have multiple accountability systems set up for exercise, study and work. Recreational activities are generally saved for evenings and weekends. This discipline is important to give the right impression to potential clients and even more so for maintaining self-respect and a sense of accomplishment.

All that said, there are certainly a number of days when my plans go off the rails. Often it begins with staying up past midnight watching TV and can extend to waking up late, missing my morning exercise habit and sometimes turns into a general lethargy. On a 'bad' day, I still write down a number of goals or to-dos, but will then just sit at my table either letting my mind wander or browsing social media sites.

Another situation that often throws my productivity off the rails is travel. This can be either business travel, vacation travel or when visitors come to me in Seattle.  It's certainly more difficult to maintain good habits when jet-lagged or when plans depend on the needs of friends or family.  For a long time, I went to great pains to maintain habits (such as regular exercise) while traveling, but I have come to accept that the real value of travel and visitors are the things you can't do while sitting at home by yourself i.e., having meaningful human interactions and experiencing new environments or activities.  So now, while I pack sneakers and gym shorts on my trips, I don't worry nearly as much  as I once did whether I get to use them.

I am curious about others' experiences...how do you cope with being thrown out of your regular routine?
