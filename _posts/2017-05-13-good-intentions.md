title:  "Good Intentions"
---
I think that I may be tripping up on my own good intentions. Since moving to Seattle, I am trying my best to establish good habits such as: 
- regular exercise;
- 5 minute Spanish lessons via Duolingo;
- meditation practice - starting with 5 minutes/day;
- writing a journal/blog;
- coding - tutorials and projects. 
These are all good things and nice goals, but very likely too much to start at one time. I have heard of studies that indicate that in order to start a habit, a person must focus at one at a time. 
My most important daily task is to do everything I can to find paying work. That reality also implies a number of habits: a consistent routine, sufficient heads down time for research/writing, a certain number of phone calls.  The hard truth is that I have actually done very little of this - some, to be sure, but only those things that are the easiest for me to do.
I think an honest course correction now would be to reassess what I have bandwidth to accomplish and what things to put aside.
