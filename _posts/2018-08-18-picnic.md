title:  "Baseball Was a Long Time Ago"
---
The speaker at the event I attended today is a retired Major Leage Baseball player who now [paints pictures for a living](https://mtstantonart.com/). The paintings were landscapes - interesting to look at, but not to my personal taste. I was very impressed by the short talk he gave and discussion he led. He spoke for a few minutes about the art, his choice of subject and technique.  Then, anticipating what would be the audience's main interest, he spoke about his baseball career. When he was wrapping up, he said some things that were really striking,

> Baseball was a long time ago. I enjoyed it - was very lucky to get to play  the game for a living. But I do this now. I try to see beauty in nature and create art from it. I go to my studio in the morning and work at it until the evening.

In the question and answer session that followed his remarks, a few people asked questions about paintings, but the questions kept going back to baseball. He answered the questions patiently and with good humor. And he stayed for a long time.  I really appreciated his patience and work ethic.
