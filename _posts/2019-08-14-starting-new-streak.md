Recently Fred Wilson posted about the beneficial effect of "streaks" on business and on life. Fred is my role model in blogging and by "streak," I believe his talking about the positive side-effects of doing something very consistently, every day if possible. In my personal life, I use a couple of apps that use streaks as part of a gamification approach, Duolingo for language learning and Insight Timer for meditation.  Being super consistent to the point of carrying streaks for months and even a year at a time has been good for me in these respective areas.

About a year ago, I committed to a "30-day" blogging challenge which really helped me to kickstart this activity. For a while afterwards, I maintained a 4x/week blogging schedule I set for myself. Early in 2019, I became inconsistent (for good reasons - my father fell ill and died) and I missed the month of July all together. This year I'm going to give myself a new goal which will be to blog five days per week until the end of 2019. Good thing that during the blog's "downtime" I have stockpiled a number of topics which should help me stay on schedule for a couple weeks.

This is a personal blog, so the topics here will be diverse. I will continue to focus on themes that are important to me:
- Data, Privacy, Technology and Public Policy
- My own journey to learn and use data science
- Exploring the Pacific Northwest, which still feels new to me even after two years
- Reactions to my own reading and viewing.

Let's take this old vehicle out for a spin!
