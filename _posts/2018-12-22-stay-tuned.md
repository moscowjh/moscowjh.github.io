I listen to a number of podcasts semi-regularly. I say "semi-" because there are few that are of such high quality that they require the listener to tune into every episode. These days one of the most informative, highest quality and (surprisingly) funniest pods is "Stay Tuned with Preet" hosted by the ex-US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara.

The episodes are informed by Bharara's legal commentary which provides valuable insights into Trump-era current events. He also demonstrates that he is a fluid and well-informed interviewer: his guests include actors, writers and comedians as well as people from the legal and political worlds.

I enjoyed this [recent episode with author Michael Lewis](https://www.cafe.com/stay-tuned-what-is-the-fifth-risk-with-michael-lewis/) whose latest book is about how the Trump administration has messed with the normally boring and under-the-radar technocratic parts of the Federal government.

I particularly enjoyed the part of the episode (about 29 minutes in) where Lewis talks about the "self-assurance" of the people he writes about (not specifically in the latest book, but in general). He says that he enjoys writing about individuals who do the right thing not to become 'heroes', but  because it is the right thing. But of course, by being featured in a Michael Lewis book, they do become heroes.
