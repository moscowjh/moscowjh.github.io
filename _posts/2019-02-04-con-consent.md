The [*New York Times* ran an editorial on Saturday](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/opinion/internet-facebook-google-consent.html) that did an excellent job describing one of the main issues facing consumers and [data privacy](https://moscowjh.github.io/data,/privacy/2019/01/31/data-it-privacy.html). The issue is that in order to use any of the most popular and vital online services (including Google, Facebook, and Amazon) a user must consent to policies which among other things would be extremely time-consuming to actually read:

> The average person would have to spend 76 working days reading all of the digital privacy policies they agree to in the span of a year. Reading Amazon’s terms and conditions alone out loud takes approximately nine hours.

Further, it's not as though anyone has a choice to agreeing other than to not use the services at all -

> It’s not as though a user can call up Mark Zuckerberg and negotiate his or her own privacy policy. The “I agree” button should have long ago been renamed “Meh, whatever.”

The editorial goes on to cite some notorious violations of privacy by the big tech companies and to suggest that the Federal Trade Commission step up to its role as a watchdog for the public good:

> Americans deserve strong privacy protections. Consent is not enough to replace them. The clicks that pass for consent are uninformed, non-negotiated and offered in exchange for services that are often necessary for civic life. It’s time to start seeing the “I agree” button for what it really is.

I completely agree. There are many reasons why tech and social media, in particular, need regulation, but the fiction of "consent" is one of the most self-evident.
