title:  "Python Visualization Libraries"
---
Was finishing the last few items on a data project that required using the Python data analytics stack. I wrote last week about [the benefits of Pandas]({% post_url 2018-08-06-pandas %}) and am elaborating here on that post.

In order to finish the project, I had to dust off my rusty skills working with the primary Python libraries for creating data visualizations - matplotlib and Seaborn. The work itself was pretty straightforward and I have enough experience now to generalize from working with various visualization tools.

What I realized as I read matplotlib and Seaborn documentation and Googled around to StackOverflow and similar sites is that any of these tools requires a moderate amount of training and a large amount of trial/error experimentation. Whatever I had learned about Python visualizations a couple months ago was still there - more or less - but in order to attain the degree of control I had achieved in several weeks of working with Tableau recently - would require more than an evening of cut/paste, trial/error.  Next step will be to go in depth with one of these technologies in order to reach a new level of mastery.
