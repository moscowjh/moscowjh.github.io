We took advantage of free museum night in Seattle (first Thursday of the month) to visit the Museum of Flight at Boeing Field. The experience was fascinating and fun: a great way to spend a dark, wet early winter evening. I should not have waited so long to visit.

Many people are aware that Seattle is the birthplace of Boeing and has played an important role in aviation history. The museum, in many ways, would be more accurately named "the Boeing museum" not because the collection is restricted to its aircraft, but because it is strongest in recording the history of Boeing in Seattle including a reconstruction of its first factory/workshop called "the Red Barn."

One of the standout features of the Museum was the presence of many volunteers who enthusiastically shared information about their favorite parts of the collection. One gentlemen pointed out a display about Boeing's very first engineer, Wong Tsu, a Chinese citizen who on what was essentially an internship after studying at MIT, designed a very  early training aircraft for a Navy contract.

This volunteer was one of several knowledgeable guides who shared their knowledge about the museum and aircraft on display.

The many historical artifacts related to Boeing reminded me that the company was born and thrived here in part because of the proximity of raw materials including metal and timber. Inexpensive real estate and cheap hydro-electric power(post-1930s) also played an important role in the company's development.

It would be wrong to write about the Museum of Flight without mentioning its magnificent collection of air- and spacecraft. The Concorde, a 707 that was the first jet airliner used as Air Force One, and an SR-71 Blackbird (a product of Boeing's rival, Lockheed) were among the standouts. In truth, there are too many great aircraft there to mention in a brief blog post.

The museum is normally an expensive place to visit - regular admission is $25 and there are relatively few discounts. No wonder that the place was packed for the free Thursday evening! Regardless, it is a spectacular collection and is very worthwhile for anyone visiting or living in the region.
