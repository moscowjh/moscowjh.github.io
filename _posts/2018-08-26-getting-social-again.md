title:  "Getting Social Again"
---
As I mentioned yesterday, I have started seeing articles and blog posts about people using social networking technology that does not require joining a big centralized entity like Facebook.  

Micro.blog is one example of an independent technology that allows for twitter-like posts of up to 280 characters. It does require a certain degree of tech knowledge and tinkering savvy to set up. Micro.blog even does some cross-posting to other social media platforms so that users can stay in touch with followers and friends who are still on other networks.  It's not clear how much infrastructure Micro.blog requires to run, what is the current size of the network, and how that would eventually scale.

Another approach that is starting to gain currency is social networking as a blockchain application.  My understanding (have not found many specifics on how these social networks would function) is that personal data would be kept by the user and that the blockchain would serve as a 'trust' layer. Although a number of such Dapps (decentralized apps) have been released, there are not yet any clear leaders. Also, the apps require that the user purchase a small amount of cryptocurrency (or a crypto-token) in order to seed the network.

Such efforts seem quixotic in the face of the scale and network effects offered by behemoths like Facebook. But people quickly forget that less than a decade ago, most of my peers didn't 'get' why they might want a FB account, let alone why they should 'post' personal updates to it.  Things can change very quickly in technology, particularly when people lose trust in an incumbent.
