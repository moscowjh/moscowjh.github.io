While I have enjoyed Dave Barry's humorous syndicated newspaper column for years, it does not appear in any newspaper I read regularly. So I was surprised to see his byline in the *Wall Street Journal* this past Saturday and [loved this column about what happens to friendships as people (specifically, Americans) age.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/learning-a-new-trick-from-my-old-dog-friendship-11552663749?shareToken=stfd6c60093bf641be9678442ca2496485)

Since the *WSJ* paywall is impenetrable to many, here is an excerpt:

>My point is that women tend to be better at making, and keeping, friends. My wife, Michelle, who is a woman, has dozens, maybe hundreds, of friends and makes new ones regularly...She is closer to all her friends than I am to any of mine.

>I am, through death and distance, losing and drifting apart from my friends. And what bothers me about this, when I stop to think about it, is that it doesn’t really bother me. The older I get, the more accustomed I am to solitude. When my family is off doing things, I can spend an entire weekend alone—making no effort to see or talk to anybody—and be perfectly content.

In my own experience, it has been difficult to maintain male friendships into middle age - even when the friendship started in grade school. And I have observed, as Barry does elsewhere in the article, that much male chatter about sports substitutes for discussion about feelings and ourselves. And, I agree with Barry's observation that women are better at maintaining friendships and having personal conversations.

This piece is both humorous and well-observed: definitely worth the two or three minutes it takes to read.
