title:  "Long Strange Trip"
---

Attended “Long Strange Trip” at recommendation of Alicia Sams, Executive Producer.

The screening took place at a large, drafty old movie theater. It was a happening - the line to get in was long. Was able to get  a photo of the aging  and young crowd.

Outstanding documentary craftsmanship.  The curation of contemporary interviews and archival film, the sound mixing, and the narrative were all excellent. It was a cultural history of the band - its life, times and its fans.

The audience was the best thing - the young couple next to me were too young to remember Jerry Garcia, but nevertheless had arrived in their 1970s Beetle, were rocking Dead tattoos and planning for this summer's legacy band shows. They were awed when I told them about my classmates, Alicia and Oteil (bassist for the Dead & Company band). The guy in front of us cut into our conversation when he overheard us talking about Ballard. He was a tall, 50-something Norwegian-looking fisherman who said he was getting onto a boat next week to spend the summer fishing in the Bering Sea and Alaska.  He boasted about the weights and the mountain bike he keeps on the fishing boat so he can stay in shape. He also described his 1970s-era VW - a camper for his months on dry land.
