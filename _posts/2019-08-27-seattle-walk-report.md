Two weeks ago attended book launch at SPL for *Seattle Walk Report*. Event filled the main auditorium at the Central Library - ~400 people.

Crazy for a first-time author. Book is based on Instagram feed of drawings from walks around Seattle. Notices quirky, mundane things. Has a wry, quirky sense of humor. Works as a branch librarian in the SPL system.

Research how to do embeds of Instagram posts on to Jekyll blog. Make it happen.

Another post idea - how blogging is teaching me technology.
