title:  "Watching Baseball in Summertime"
---
I have been a baseball fan for over forty years now. My level of interest in its various aspects waxes and wanes somewhat. At the moment, I am a little put off by some trends in Major League Baseball and my favorite teams have not been competitive this year.  Nevertheless, I am a steady fan and there are few things that I enjoy more on a summer evening than listening to the sounds and seeing the colors and shapes of a game. There is no other American sport (and I love most sports) that combines tremendous athletic skill, a chess-like mind game, and a relaxed pace of play. By a stroke of luck, MLB - conservative in most aspects - has been among the best of major professional sports at figuring out how to present its games digitally.  That has made it easier for me as I have moved around the country to continue following the game, my teams and my favorite players.
