title:  "2017 in Review"
---
2017 was a big year for me. After spending Q1 living with Jono on NYC's UWS, I drove cross-country and transplanted myself to Seattle.

I am proud to have accomplished a number of things during the year:
- disengaged from work and other familiar patterns of every day life in NYC and reestablished healthy daily habits in Seattle.
- Spent significant time in Seattle building relationships, nurturing existing friendships, and acquainting myself with a few old friends I had not seen for a long time.
- Studied new technology throughout the year and, in particular, dove deeper into data science for the last 3 1/2 months. Data science has clicked with me like no other technology area. I believe it has helped me reach a new career frontier.
- Did a decent amount of exploring throughout the year by driving cross-country, traveling to a few different parts of the PNW, on brief trips to California,  Nicaragua, and Martha's Vineyard (my first visit to an island I have heard about for many years).
- Reconciled myself with divorce and stayed friendly with AM. At same time, built foundations of a new relationship.
- Stayed in regular, close contact with my daughter and son, mainly via text messaging and social media, but also spent some nice phone and face-to-face time with each.
- Found two nice places to live in Seattle: a serene, beautiful landing pad in Ballard and a well-located, aesthetic 1BR in Capitol Hill which enabled me to consolidate my belongings and feel as though I am at home here.

There are also a few things that didn't go as well:
- I have not yet found full-time work in Seattle though it seems clear there are appropriate jobs out here. In past, networking has been enough to 'land' me something, but here it is not working.
- Related to no full-time work: too much anxiety. I have not been able to "trust the process" and accept that it will take a while. The meditation and exercise have helped in this area.
- Related to anxiety: I over-ate and gained pounds despite exercising actively throughout the year.

These last few items provide areas to focus and improve in 2018. Am still considering whether, aside from remediating these areas, I wish to make any special resolution for the New Year.
