title:  "New Year Roadtrip"
---

I am marking the early part of the year by making an 8-day road trip from Seattle to Los Angeles and back.

It's mind-blowing that we are only (still) in the second week of the year! The holiday 'break' already seems as though it was long ago. Early weeks of a year usually feel like a fresh, hopeful start: the hope being that this year it will be possible to make up for whatever the previous year was missing.

I love a road trip...seeing new scenery, the improvisational aspect of not knowing exactly where a day will start and end, stopping to see friends who live along the route and brief encounters with strangers in restaurants and coffee shops. This is my first trip down the length of the west coast: though my specific timing has meant sticking to the biggest interstate, I5, some of the scenery in the NW was spectacular.

It is also true that one of the purposes of the trip is to reintroduce myself to the sun a few months into my first PNW winter. After driving through rain in Washington and Oregon, the sun appeared almost immediately after crossing the state line into California. Staying one day in San Jose, I enjoyed a hike in sunny foothills of Cupertino with my friend, D. Am making another one-day stop (with hike) in Carmel to see another family friend. Then it's on to LA and a (forecast) warm weekend down south.
