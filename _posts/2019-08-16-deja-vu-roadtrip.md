I took a mini-roadtrip today to get interviewed for the US Customs and Border Control Nexus program. Nexus issues a card that lets a US or Canadian citizen blast through the border in either direction. It was recommended by a friend who attended university in Vancouver and who travels frequently back and forth.

The interview was brief and successful (my application was approved) and the day served as a one-day "getaway." With relatively sparse traffic, the two-hour drive was pleasant and I took the opportunity to stop for lunch in Bellingham and for a hike in Larrabee State Park on the shores of Samish Bay off the very scenic Chuckanut Drive. I also made a quick stop in Edison, a pretty little town designed for food lovers.

The entire day resulted in a sense of deja vu. The Nexus facility, located near the Canadian border, was similar to the Non-Immigrant Visa line where I worked for two years in Bogota (over a quarter century-ago). While both the US and Canadian officials who interviewed me were pleasant and professional, there is a specific atmosphere present at Federal facilities. Fortunately, I was there for only about 30-minutes so was able to contemplate the "deja-vu." Also, Bellingham and Samish Bay were the first parts of Washington State I explored after arriving in Seattle two years ago, so spending the late afternoon in those places brought a different and entirely delightful feeling of deja vu.
