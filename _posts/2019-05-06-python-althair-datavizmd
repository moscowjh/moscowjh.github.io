Sometimes the internet can still astound with high-quality, useful information that ordinary humans have posted. One very good source for this kind of item is [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) - mostly, but not exclusively, about technical topics. I occasionally look at Hacker News as in the same way that I look at twitter (another way to discover excellent, but out-of-mainstream reading).

Today, for example, I found [this excellent blog about Altair](http://fernandoi.cl/blog/posts/altair/), a Python wrapper for a JavaScript visualization library called Vega-Lite. The problem that the author addresses is that one disadvantage of using Python for data analysis is that its primary visualization libraries are weaker than GGPlot, commonly used in R programs.

What's great about this particular blog post is that it succinctly describes the problem, the proposed solution, and walks the reader through a couple code samples including both an incomplete and a better solution to the problem. It is super easy for a Python-literate reader to cut and paste the code to run it on her local machine. I plan to do this myself this evening.
