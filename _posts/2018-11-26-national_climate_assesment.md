title:  "Weekend Reading: Fourth National Climate Assessment Report"
---
The Trump administration released the [National Climate Assessment](https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/) report the day after Thanksgiving. It was a blatant attempt to use the holiday weekend to obscure the careful work of government and other scientists. It's important that we honor their work by paying attention and reading it. At the very least, citizens should read the Summary Findings and any Report Chapters about their specific regions.

The photo comes from the chapter on the Pacific Northwest and reminds me of the very heavy wildfire smoke that marred the glorious PNW summers each of the past two years. Photo credit: Charles Luce.
