title:  "Data Analytics Late-Term Report"
---

This post was drafted a few months ago and, if anything, I have fallen into an even bigger rut in terms of my data analytics progress. A number of things - notably a short-term work engagement that involved travel - derailed me, but there are no excuses. And what I wrote remains as true as it was before.

I am now six projects in to the Data Analytics 'Nanodegree' that I started last fall. It has gone well: moving from fairly simple programming exercises to much more complex software work and even some statistical coursework (not a lot but more than I had ever done before). The current project even switched things up a little requiring that we learn the fundaments of the R programming language and and with Tableau, a non-programmatic tool for creating visualizations from data. Like any well-structured course of learning, the DAND has taken me out of my comfort zone and pushed me in ways I could not have imagined.

That said, I find that if I do not put in regular hours writing code and concentrate while writing it, my learning goes off the rails. I have recently had a series of visitors - my first in Seattle - and though while it was easy enough to sit down and do coding exercises for a couple hours per day, I have not been able to focus to get the project done.

In any event, this 'thing' has its hold on me now and I am not going to let a few distractions halt my forward progress. Whether I complete the certification next month or not, it will get done. My largest takeaway is that data analytics skills are really just the basis for further learning and skill development. Whether that means studying more advanced math and stats, more software engineering to become a data engineer, or machine learning in order to move in the direction of AI, I don't yet know.

I do know that it will be challenging to land employment in the field - not easy
for anyone and especially tricky at 50+ to persuade someone to hire me on the more junior end of the professional scale.  What I do know is that regardless of further 'career' success, I am confident of finding interesting ways to employ my new skills and to do some notable things with what I have learned.
