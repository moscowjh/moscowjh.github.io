title:  "Blogging Challenge!"
---

With this post, I am issuing myself a challenge to continue a daily posting streak
for the month of August... a total of 31 consecutive days. There are a number
of things about this challenge that will be difficult:

1. Writing is hard. I am always surprised by the amount of effort required to communicate
 ideas well and succinctly. Even a simple post with one main idea will require
focus, concentration, and time for both drafting and editing.

1. Often it seems that there is not enough going on in my own mind to interest even
myself, let alone the mythical reader (present or future). We'll test that hypothesis.

However, without a default schedule, blog posts have dwindled even below last year's
limited number. This will be only my fifth post in 2018. I have had some successful
streaks in a couple other learning and habit-forming areas: Duolingo for Spanish
language learning and Insight Timer for  meditation.

So I am going to make another attempt at a daily blogging habit. Some days, it may
be quite short with only a link or a couple of lines, but let's give it a go!
