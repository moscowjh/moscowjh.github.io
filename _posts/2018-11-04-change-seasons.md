title:  "Change of Seasons"
---

The clocks changed this weekend which also means we have reached late autumn. One thing that has surprised me this year, my second in Seattle, is how much I looked forward to the changes which mark this particular season. The daylight hours are short - noticeably fewer than half the daily 24 - and there are many more gray and rainy days. But when the sun does peak through, the cloud formations are dramatic and fascinating. Today's sunset which I observed while driving home from north Seattle was one of the most beautiful I remember. The air is cool and clean; a contrast with the wildfire smoke of late summer. Actually, until now, it hasn't been all that cold with highs *and* lows in the 50s. I find that I enjoy having fewer decisions to make about what to do with my time. When it is rainy and/or dark, I keep my head down in my work, socialize with friends or watch TV.  When the sun comes out, I get out for walks and look at the trees and birds. I remember always feeling a sense of dread when the last markers of summer disappear, but that is no longer the case. I look forward to next summer, but am happy to pass through all the autumn, winter and spring milestones until we do reach summer of 2019.
