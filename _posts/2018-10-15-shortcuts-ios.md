title:  "iOS Shortcuts"
---

Apple recently introduced the Shortcuts app as part of its iOS12 update. Shortcuts is an update of Workflow, an app created by the company of the same name which Apple [acquired in early 2017](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/apple-has-acquired-workflow-a-powerful-automation-tool-for-ipad-and-iphone/). Shortcuts is a scripting tool that allow users to tie together different actions in iOS itself and in apps that include support for the technology. Shortcuts are not created by writing code, but instead by selecting actions from a menu of options.

One thing I have noticed is that new scripting tools are sometimes introduced with lots of fanfare, but that no matter how powerful they are, only a fraction of users actually take advantage of them. One reason I have been eager to try out the tool since Apple made it available for free to iOS users, is to judge for myself just how hard or easy it is to use. As a longtime iPhone and iPad user, I have noticed that I spend an awful lot of time on my devices and that a decent percentage of that time is spent performing repetitive tasks. So reducing repetition and total screen time is a significant motivation.

I downloaded Shortcuts: it is a free download, but not included automatically with iOS. In the Shortcuts homescreen, there is a Library section for scripts the user has written or adapted from downloaded shortcuts. And there is also Gallery section which Apple has populated with shortcuts it deems useful. For the overall look of the app, see the left screenshot below:\

I glanced online at a couple of "how-to" articles which helped me to understand that probably the best way to learn is to take an existing script and modify it. So I found a script called "Say Cheese" which launches the camera and snaps a photo. "Say Cheese" consists of the actions indicated in the middle screenshot above.

I decided that it would be nice to have a similar shortcut called "selfie" which would do the same thing except that instead of using the outward facing camera, would take a picture with the user-facing camera, a selfie. Creating "selfie" required me to rename the script, set up a siri action-word ("selfie") and to modify the camera action to use the front-facing camera. The new script is shown at above right.

Everything I have described in this post took me around 20 minutes to accomplish (except for for writing the post itself), so I would say that Workflow looks to be both powerful and easy-to-use. I am planning to post more about scripts I create as I become a more proficient user.
