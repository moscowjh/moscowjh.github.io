title:  "Cle Elum!"
---
The community Kevin took me to today is called Cle Elum <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cle_Elum,_Washington>.  The resort where we walked and where he and where he and Alison will spend their anniversary weekend is Suncadia <https://www.destinationhotels.com/suncadia-resort>.  Very pretty surroundings, but not my personal style.  The region is the eastern slopes of the Cascades, so it is normally quite sunny. That was not the case todayâ€¦it rained during our walk, but it was less rainy than the place we intended to hike.
