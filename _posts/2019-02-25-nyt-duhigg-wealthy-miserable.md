A friend sent out an email to a group of peers asking us for our opinion of [this *New York Times Magazine* piece by Charles Duhigg](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/21/magazine/elite-professionals-jobs-happiness.html), author of the best selling business book, *The Power of Habit.*

I skimmed the piece, noticing that Duhigg used the narrative hook of discussing his peers at Harvard Business School during a recent class reunion. My initial take was:

> It seems to me that Duhigg is trolling his HBS classmates. He says at the end that he "didn't need any courage to go into the modest paying (by H.B.S. standards) field of journalism." First of all, I'm sure that his conventional choices were not limited only to McKinsey, private equity and a real-estate conglomerate which he says rejected him. Second, he is the author of at least one best-seller and is one of the most in-demand business authors in the country.  I'm sure that Duhigg took a lot of shit for leaving the conventional "fast track" but then it turned out that he was fortunate (and maybe talented/hard-working) enough to get onto another.

Over the past couple days, I had the opportunity to read the piece more carefully and while I do think there is an element of conscious or sub-conscious "trolling," I am afraid that the real problem with the article is that the analysis is faulty.

Duhigg says that he left his Harvard reunion wondering whether his class is an anomaly and "began looking for data about the nationâ€™s professional psyche." However [the only data he cites is a Conference Board report](https://www.conference-board.org/blog/postdetail.cfm?post=6391) (actually a blog about the report which is proprietary and not available for public inspection). The key finding cited in the Duhigg article is that job satisfaction was around 60% in the 1980s and is below 50% today.

First of all, we have no indication how the survey approached the topic of "job satisfaction." Did the population sample contacted represent professional workers (like HBS grads), government workers, skilled or unskilled laborers (or other categories)? Did the survey maintain a uniform approach to questions about job satisfaction over the period indicated? One thing that can be said is that the time interval indicated in the bar chart accompanying the Conference Board blog post is inconsistent. According to the graph, the entire decline in job satisfaction occurred between 1987 and 2000; since then there has been fluctuation within a narrow range and in recent years, since the end of the 2008 economic slump, job satisfaction has increased by eight percentage points.

My conclusion is that while there may be a story to be written about "Wealth, Successful and Miserable," it is not the article that Duhigg has in fact written. His piece uses anecdotal observations to make broad, societal conclusions and misuses what little data he musters to support his argument. Neither the author nor the editors of the *Times* should have proceeded with its publication in this form.
