title:  "Day of Thanks"
---
Today is Thursday, November 22, 2018 - Thanksgiving Day in the US.

I am grateful for many things today (and everyday):
- My family in all of its glory;
- My other loved ones - friends who are my second family;
- Health - my own and that of everyone close to me.
- Nature - the stunning beauty of the Pacific NW awakens appreciation of nature for all who are fortunate enough to live here.

And for lots of other wonderful things.

As part of my observance of Thanksgiving Day this year, I am posting photos from a recent day trip to Vashon Island on a cool clear Saturday.
