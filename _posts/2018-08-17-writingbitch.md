title:  "Writing is a bitch"
---
A young person in my life is an excellent writer, but frequently tells me and others that she "hates" writing.  This usually comes up when it is suggested that she consider writing or editing as a profession.  And, in fact, for more than a year, she held down two professional writing gigs which she quit to travel in Southeast Asia.  When she returned from the trip, she found other jobs very different from her previous writing assignments.

It is clear from this person's very witty and insightful cards, email and text messages that she derives great pleasure in expressing herself well. It's also pretty clear that she doesn't hate writing when she feels like it.  

The assignment I gave myself on [July 30]({% post_url 2018-07-30-blogging-streak %}) has taught me what it means to "hate writing."  Writing on a daily (or on someone else's) cadence is torture. For a few days, one's compositions can derive from a small number of stored-up ideas. Or from topics that come up in a one's work.  But sooner or later, that reserve dries up and one is still greeted by a deadline (self-imposed or otherwise).

I have a number of professional-writer friends several of whom are very accomplished. I have long acknowledged their skill, erudition and wit. What this task has taught me is to admire their ability to face down a deadline and somehow to draw blood from stone!
