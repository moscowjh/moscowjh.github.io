title:  "Link Love: Seattle Sketcher"
---

Like a lot of people, I get the majority of my news via digital media. I do pay for online subscriptions to a number of national outlets that feature important reporting including the *Wall Street Journal*, the *New York Times* and the *Washington Post.*

However, I do love to read print newspapers and missed having a paper in the house, so I recently started weekend delivery of the *Seattle Times.*  The *Times'* coverage is pretty good on PNW regional issues including the environment, regional politics, economics, and business.

One of the my favorite *Seattle Times* features is the drawing of the 'Seattle Sketcher', Gabriel Campanario.  This post was inspired by the scene [that appeared on publication day](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/this-beloved-seattle-park-has-a-new-gateway-to-happiness/), but I also recommend that the reader [peruse the Seattle Sketcher archive](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattlesketcher) at any time if you want to learn about a variety of places and moments that make this city quirky and special.
