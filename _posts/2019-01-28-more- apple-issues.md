My writing schedule has been severely affected by a family medical emergency. January 2019 will be my least consistent writing month since before embarking on the 30-day writing challenge back in August.

I will add a thought to the view on Apple articulated in the previous post. This is based on personal (i.e., anecdotal) experience. On Friday, I took my octogenarian Mom to the Apple Store in Pasadena, California intending to purchase her first iPhone. Both of my parents have become iPad users over the past few years, but like many elderly people have not cottoned to the idea of ubiquitous connectivity embodied by the iPhone. This changed recently because my father was taken ill and my mother will need to be able to communicate more and to summon transport on demand.

On Friday, as we walk into the Apple Store, I give my name to one of three iPad carrying concierges standing near the entrance. They position us by one of the tables on which the latest model phones are displayed. We wait. And we wait. We wait some more. I go back to one of the concierges and ask that they prioritize this elderly customer.  "Thank you for waiting. You are second in the queue." I go back to my mother and ask if she wants to sit on a stool (she refuses). We wait again. 10 minutes later, I go back to one of the concierges for an update. Now we are next in the queue. Finally, after 10 minutes more waiting, we leave without having purchased anything.

Obviously, this is one isolated incident and may not be at all representative. In my previous post, I minimized the negative case that has been made against Apple by citing its focus on security/privacy, the usability of its products, and its head start in the wearables market. One thing I didn't mention was Apple's customer focus including the service in its retail stores. Apple is competing against many excellent tech products by occupying the premium space in the market and offering personalized service at the Apple stores. If the level of service declines and the image of its service level declines with it, that's another pillar of its business that will have crumbled.
