Late summer in Seattle is a delight. I probably have written this here before, but I don't at all mind repeating myself. Most days are sunny, dry with temperatures in the 70s. Unlike the previous two summers, this year we haven't yet had any smoky days influenced by wildfires from Eastern WA or British Columbia.

In the past week, I have played tennis, hiked on the shores of the Salish Sea, biked around the city, and shopped at our local outdoor farmers' market. Probably my favorite activity is just walking around the local neighborhoods - Capitol Hill, Montlake, First Hill, downtown. There are enough trees and enough wind that the air is almost always fresh. Tonight I will attend the Mariners-Yankees game - it will be my second and final local baseball game this year.  For the opportunity to enjoy all of these things, I am grateful.
