*The NY Times* ran [an interactive feature yesterday which analyzed, discussed and demonstrated what companies learn about consumers from location data](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html?module=inline) transmitted by our cell phones.

The report was not so much breaking news (at some level, most smartphone users are aware that companies are collecting data about them, including location data) than it is a thorough examination of certain companies and apps which transmit and aggregate location data. It also is a test of what anyone who buys this kind of data from an aggregator can learn about consumers, even at an individual level.

The interactive aspect of the report includes a number of aerial maps demonstrating the tracking of individuals the *Times* describes in the article (with their permission, of course) and how tracking can identify people at locations such as medical clinics or their workplace where they might not want to be identified.

The companies contacted by the *NYT* reporters offered some version of the following justification:

> Many location companies say that when phone users enable location services, their data is fair game. But, The Times found, the explanations people see when prompted to give permission are often incomplete or misleading. An app may tell users that granting access to their location will help them get traffic information, but not mention that the data will be shared and sold. That disclosure is often buried in a vague privacy policy.

In fact, some of the individuals cited in the article mention enjoying the benefits of location-aware apps and say that they realize that they are giving away data in return for the free use of the app. To that point, I personally am a user of Swarm, a check-in app distributed by the locations services company, Foursquare. Foursquare provides reviews and rankings of local restaurants and other businesses derived from app usage and user surveys.

However, the issue of incomplete or misleading prompts and of disclosures buried in vague legalese is real. Also appalling is the fact that this data can be aggregated and sold without any limitation at all. Big tech is currently all over the place on its policies about location data. Under pressure that has been building since the tainted 2016 election, the internet giants are at least paying lip service to users' privacy. However, these companies also have incentives to keep their paying customers (such as advertisers and data aggregators) happy. As a result even Apple, the most pro-privacy of the large tech companies, has backed away from measures it promised recently to regulate app developers' use of location services.

With everything else going on in US politics, it is unclear how much outrage is going to build around this issue right now. What is clear to me that this is an area that will benefit from political accountability every bit as much as Facebook's misuse of private user data.
