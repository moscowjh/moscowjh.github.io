I was extremely pleased to learn last week that Sade had recently released a new song. When I looked it up in Apple Music, I realized that there were actually two new songs this year. Both were released as part of movie soundtracks rather than as part of a new Sade album. Since Sade generally releases albums every 6-10 years and it has been 8 years since her most recent collection of new music, we can only hope that 2019 brings a larger release.

There are many things I love about Sade and her music: the connection with my youth (her first album was released in 1984), her unique sound - I can only think of Steely Dan as a comparable band, and the personality that emerges in the very few articles or interviews about her. The artist values privacy, seems to be the opposite of a diva, and remains creative and productive at age 59.

Before posting this item, I checked my facts and realized that 'Sade' strictly speaking refers to the band of which Sade Adu is the lead singer. That is another sign that Adu is a non-diva. I admire both the band's music (good job, lads!) and the lead singer's voice. I will not bother to change the pronouns I used above.

In any event, for your listening enjoyment here are the Sade's two songs released in 2018, Flower of Love and The Big Unknown:
