> Summer is over west of the Cascade crest.  Heat waves are done.  Dense smoke in western Washington is finished.

This is the lead from the September 8, 2018 post on the [Cliff Mass Weather and Climate Blog](http://cliffmass.blogspot.com/) which has become required reading for me since moving to Seattle. Mass is an academic meteorologist at UW who also maintains a popular blog, does a weekly spot on public radio, and has written a book on weather in the PNW.

For those of us fascinated by weather (and yes, I am), Mass's writing goes deep enough to explain unusual phenomena and, sometimes, to debunk conventional wisdom. For instance, during the past month when Seattle was covered by smoke from wildfires in various parts of western North America, it became a standard spot on national media for various 'authorities' to say that this summer's fires were unprecedented, clearly the result of climate change, and that Seattle's air will probably never return to its previous standard. While not disputing that climate change is a major contributor to longer, drier summers in the PNW, Mass articulated a [more nuanced hypothesis that the smoke is a return to the way summers were in the late 19th and early-20th centuries before society became adept at suppressing wildfires](http://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2018/08/northwest-wildfires-are-we-seeing-new.html).

As mentioned a couple posts ago, Michael Lewis has released (an audio-only) work called *The Coming Storm.*  It is tangentially about weather and climate as it uses the National Weather Service as one of the earliest examples of what we now call 'big data' and also as an example of a government service that benefits a broad swath of the US population. While Lewis talks about a few major weather events and about some of the types of data collected, the purpose of the book is not a deep dive into the data. However, it sure made me curious to learn more about weather data and to do some deep diving myself at some point.
