title:  "Imagining Eastern Washington"
---

As I write, I am watching the Apple Cup, the annual football rivalry matchup between University of Washington and Washington State University. This year's game in Pullman, WA is taking place in a swirling snowstorm. On TV, it looks as though the teams are playing in a snow globe.

It doesn't snow much in the Puget Sound region, west of the Cascades. Yet, Washington State has mountains that receive some of the highest annual snowfall in the United States. Beyond the Cascades, the eastern part of the state is a high plateau with a real continental winter. I haven't been there yet, so it is still something of a mystery to me. I look forward to exploring it and am posting landscape photo to share that dream with the reader.
