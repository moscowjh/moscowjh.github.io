title:  "HQ2 - Reactions to the Announcement"
---
Amazon made its long-awaited announcement this week that it will be opening its "second headquarters" in not one, but two locations: Arlington, Virginia and Queens, New York. The announcement was foreshadowed by two weeks of unattributed news reports, many of which proved in the end to be true.

It has been fascinating to pay attention to reactions to the announcement, which have been all over the map. In NYC, proclamations of delight which followed the official announcement have been tempered as people understood the magnitude of the incentives Amazon is receiving to locate 25,000 people there. Many New Yorkers have observed that infrastructure and the local housing market are already stretched to the limit. Amazon's arrival and the fact that the incentives to bring it to NY will come out of State/Local budgets, will serve to make life more difficult for many New Yorkers.

I also have heard two diametrically opposing interpretations of what the split location of HQ2 means for HQ1, Amazon's current home base in Seattle. One argument says that since neither DC nor NYC "won" the full complement of 50,000 employees promised in the HQ2 RFP, that Seattle will remain preeminent. The other interpretation holds that with the company's growth, increasing political profile, and its founder Jeff Bezos' interests in DC and NY, Seattle will become a backwater.

It would be interesting in the near future to do a systematic review of the reaction and commentary. My hypothesis based on what I have seen so far is that Amazon is so big and important that the reactions reflect the expertise and concerns of the commentators as much as they do the actual thought process or decisions within Amazon. The US media is not very good at covering business (with some notable exceptions) and it tends to conflate or mix up tactics and strategy. To give an example, for many years, I had to argue with New York publishing friends that Amazon was not primarily a bookstore or publishing business, but much more about Web Services (AWS). People really didn't understand - they just didn't get it. Of course, AWS, huge as it is, is also only part of the story.

I see two things that are undoubtedly true:
- Amazon is a company with a strong culture, brilliant leadership, and a bias toward building for the long-term.
- As impressive as it is, Amazon is optimized for customer and shareholder gain (as encouraged by US laws and business culture). It is not looking out for public or community benefit except as those things can be quantified as risks that could block customer and shareholder benefits.
Amazon will need to be guided and (likely) regulated to act in a way that is consistent with the public good.
