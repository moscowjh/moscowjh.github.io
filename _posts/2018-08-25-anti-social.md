title:  "Anti-Social"
---
In the past couple years, there definitely has been a withdrawal in my circle from the main social media networks, especially from Facebook. Some, including myself, are disenchanted because the results of the US 2016 election exposed what a bad custodian of user data the major social networking corporations have been. But I think disenchantment really pre-dated the election and is widespread even among folks who don't care about political repercussions.

The points that seem to come up most often when people discuss leave social media are:
- wasting too much time on social media;
- anxiety caused by fear of missing out (FOMO)
- anxiety caused by overexposure to other people's too-perfect lives
- anxiety caused by maintaining one's own too perfect social media persona
- exposure to unpleasant political views
- overexposure to other people's personal lives and feelings

All of these points are authentic: some are possible to mitigate by taking action oneself and others are not. I myself have thought about leaving Facebook entirely. When I have considered it, the following issues present themselves:
- I would entirely lose touch with certain parts of my past - particularly international friends.
- It would be much more difficult to learn about and sign up for certain group events.
- I would miss life updates from friends whom I don't see very often. For example, couple friends, occasional users of Facebook, observed to me that the platform was perfect for sharing news of their parents' deaths.
- I would lose to the ability to authenticate on other sites using FB credentials. Arguably, I shouldn't have allowed myself to fall into that trap, but that is where a I find myself.
- I would lose (actually already have lost) a medium for self-expression that I enjoyed. I was on social media earlier than my peers and when I have seen acquaintances subsequently, a surprising number of them are aware of developments in my life because of my 2008-2013 FB posts.
- I would lose a significant source of news and images of people, places and culture which have enriched my life.

Taken together these items are benefits provided by social media (not just Facebook). Allowing for some reservations, I believe these benefits of social media outweigh the negatives. I would like to preserve these benefits, but do not necessarily want these interactions to be mediated by Facebook, Snap or Twitter Inc.

Recently I have started reading that some people are starting to frequent different social networks on the "decentralized" web. In a future post (perhaps tomorrow's), I will write about what "decentralized" means in this case and how those networks are different from the existing social media apps.
