Paul Allen, who died last fall, supported and saved many institutions in his hometown of Seattle. The NFL Seahawks and the University of Washington are two of the higher profile, more celebrated instances of Allen's activity. On this weekend, two days before the Oscars will be rewarded, I will tip my cap toward Cinerama, which may have been the most personal of Allen's rescues and the one which best reflects his interests.

Cinerama is a 1963 movie theater in the Belltown district near downtown Seattle. After its heyday in the 1960s, it apparently endured three decades of decline. Allen purchased it in the late 1990s and has operated it since. He has renovated it three times, most recently in 2014. It has the most advanced projection systems and really first-rate sound.

Cinerama's high ticket prices kept me away for a while after I moved to Seattle, but over the past few months I have seen two of this year's Best Picture nominees there: *Roma* and *A Star is Born.* Both pictures benefitted from the high-end audiovisual capabilities. The seats at the Cinerama are large and comfortable. The concessions are upscale, but are not meant to overshadow the film. This is not a place to get dinner while watching the movie.

I've must say that Cinerama is the perfect moviegoing experience for me. The theater is a long walk from my apartment - public transit is also an option. The films are carefully curated and the best prints or digital copies procured. The ticket prices (with no discounts) keep the audiences reasonably small.

Thanks, Paul.
