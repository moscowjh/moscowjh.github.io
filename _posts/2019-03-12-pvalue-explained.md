Easing back into regular blogging today after tending to urgent family business for a few weeks; I am also returning to posting regularly about statistics and data science, which was the original and still, a main, theme of this blog.

An acquaintance posted the YouTube video below from a senior engineer at Google. It explains one of the basic concepts used in inferential statistics, the p-value. Though I like the accessibility of this explanation, I actually find it to be a little too devoid of math. It certainly is charming and if one has actually used p-values a bit, it really does help you to get your head around the idea in 3-minutes.

If a person really wants to understand p-values within the broader topic of hypothesis testing it would behoove her to watch [this series of videos from Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/significance-tests-one-sample/idea-of-significance-tests/v/p-values-and-significance-tests). It might take 60-90 minutes to watch and really absorb the concepts.
