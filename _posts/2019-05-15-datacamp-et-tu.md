In my journey to learn data science, I have used a number of different tools - books and online tutorials/courses. One of the resources is called DataCamp: I used it a bit last year and bought a paid subscription at the beginning of 2019. It covers a broad swath of data-related topics with materials that include courses, projects and learning tracks. DataCamp has been notably successful at raising start-up capital - having raised [$31 million](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/data-camp/funding_rounds/funding_rounds_list#section-funding-rounds) in seven funding rounds.

Over the past several months, a sexual harassment scandal has come to light involving DataCamp's CEO (also a founder) and a former employee. The entire story including the harassment and a year-long effort by the company to sweep the episode under the carpet is [recounted in this investigative article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/datacamp-sexual-harassment-metoo-tech-startup) published earlier this week in BuzzFeed news.

When confronted with the conduct, DataCamp repeatedly told the victim it  was taking steps to address the serious issues raised. While a number of steps were taken, they tended to be of a perfunctory corporate nature such as hiring a "Chief People Officer," updating its harassment policy, publishing blog posts about women in data science. The company did not make any kind of communication with its employees or admit publicly to the incident. Nevertheless, a large number of company employees and course developers (subject-matter experts who are independent contractors to DataCamp) were aware of the incident and some of its consequences.

Remarkably, a number of these independent course developers approached DataCamp early this year and were able to affect more significant changes in the company's direction. Many of these experts are associated with the R programming language community - in particular a group called R-Ladies. Essentially, the leverage they have over the company is that they publish courses on the DataCamp platform. DataCamp is reliant on their skill as educators and their reputations to attract paying students like myself.

DataCamp's response, even after meeting with the course developers was slow. First, it published ['A Note to Our Community'](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/note-to-our-community) which had a "let's avoid corporate liability" tone and did not identify that the harasser was its chief executive. A few weeks later, the [CEO apologized in his own blog post](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/apology) and announced that he would be stepping aside for an indefinite period. DataCamp's Board amplified these points [in its own post](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/board-update), adding that the CEO's potential return would be conditional on the findings of a (new) third-party review.

The two most recent company blog posts talk a lot about regaining the community's trust. Trust is indeed a company's most valuable currency. Particularly in a highly competitive market, such as online education, where the barriers to entry are relatively low, what distinguishes one company from another are subject-matter, brand, product quality and (about all) reputation. DataCamp is still doing well on the first three areas, but this episode has severely tarnished its reputation with important components of its community. It will be interesting to see if the company is able to survive this blow.
