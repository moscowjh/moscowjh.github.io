Happy New Year and best wishes for health, joy and success in 2019!  I am resuming my normal publishing schedule after a brief, but unplanned, blogging break for the holidays.

In that vein, I am linking to [this upbeat WSJ column by Greg Ip](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-world-is-getting-quietly-relentlessly-better-11546430400?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=6) citing positive trends in global demographic data such as declining poverty rates and the increasing percentage of world population which can be classified as "middle class." While I believe Ip is somewhat overstating grounds for optimism, he is doing so to make a point which is the same one that [former President Obama has made on several occasions](https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/20/politics/obama-speech-gates-foundation/index.html):

> By almost every measure, America is better, and the world is better, than it was 50 years ago, or 30 years ago, or even 10 years ago.

Of particular interest are two data-oriented research publications Ip cites - [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), based at Oxford University and the [World Data Lab](http://www.worlddata.io/). I look forward to examining the data sources and possibly writing more about the data and issues in this space.
