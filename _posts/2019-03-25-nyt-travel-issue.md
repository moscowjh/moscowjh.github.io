Despite efforts to make myself a homebody, the truth is that I love traveling. I even enjoy many of the routine or dreary parts of it, like killing time in airports. If there is anything that even exceeds travel, itself, in terms of enjoyment, it is reading good articles or stories about travel.  When I saw that yesterday's Sunday *NYT* featured a magazine dedicated exclusively to the topic of travel, I ran out to buy a copy of the paper.

The [cover article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/03/20/magazine/rick-steves-travel-world.html) is about Rick Steves, American author, media personality and travel entrepreneur. Steves believes that by enabling Americans to travel in an immersive way, he is breaking down cultural barriers and "saving the world one vacation at a time." It is fascinating to read how this Seattle-area man built a travel media and tour business from nothing.

Another entertaining article is [Caity Weaver's "We're All in this Together: The Particular Sheen of America by Amtrak"](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/03/20/magazine/train-across-america-amtrak.html) about a train ride from NYC to LA. The article is particular good about the monotony of the long journey and the ugliness of large parts of the American landscape. I have driven cross-continent three times and mostly remember the glorious bits, but on also spends lots time driving by Walmarts, abandoned quarries, and RV/trailer parks.

I haven't been doing any recreational travel lately, but "The Voyages Issue" set me thinking about trips to plan over the next months and years.
