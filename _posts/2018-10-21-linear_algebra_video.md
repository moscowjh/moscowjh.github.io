title:  "Weekend Link: Essence of Linear Algebra"
---

I am in the early days of teaching myself everything I can absorb about Machine Learning and other current technologies related to AI. One thing that all the basic ML materials emphasize is that Linear Algebra is the mathematical foundation of machine learning. It's possible to learn to implement python-based Machine Learning models without understanding the underlying math, but my view is "what's the point of that?" My formal mathematical education stopped short of Linear Algebra, so I have been doing Linear Algebra exercises on Khan Academy and was recently turned on to *Essence of Linear Algebra* video series by 3Blue1Brown. I'm four videos in and, I have to admit, the last couple videos have not been easy for me to follow. However, the video animation is beautiful so I encourage you watch at least a few minutes of the first video.
