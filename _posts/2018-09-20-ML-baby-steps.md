title:  "Baby Steps with ML"
---
Hardly a day goes my when an offer to start a course or bootcamp in machine learning doesn't land in my email inbox. "Machine learning engineer" is one of the hot job titles in tech and Artificial Intelligence, more broadly, is front-page news.

I have ignored these offers because I know that my math is not yet advanced enough to understand the underlying ML algorithms. While in practice, the "hard stuff" is abstracted away in packages that can be invoked with a line or two of code, I am the kind of person who strongly prefers to understand everything happening "underneath the covers."

Nevertheless, my skills with data science tools have improved to the point where some basic understanding of how ML works in practice is a logical next step. I purchased a recommended book on Machine Learning and have also been doing some exercises on Kaggle, the data science competitions site which recently became part of Google.

After about three days of study, the book and exercises are starting to give me an idea about the problems machine learning can be used to solve. I am able to understand high-level descriptions of how the different algorithms work. And I can see that, in practice, a lot of the human work in ML engineering is in curating, cleaning and tidying data sets (used to train and validate the ML models). That, by itself, is a valuable lesson.

Stay tuned for more posts on this topic.  I plan to continue working on my Machine Learning Skills for quite a while.
