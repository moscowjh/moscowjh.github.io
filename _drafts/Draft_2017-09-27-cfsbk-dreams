title:  "CFSBK Dreams"
---

When I walked into 597 Degraw in fall 2010, I was totally unsuspecting. I knew after my first three classes (with Margie, Fox and David) that the coaches were mindful, uncompromising about form, and generally all about doing everything the right way. Yep, it was a good gym!

Only in the fullness of time, did I come to understand what an engaging, crazy-fun but serious-about-fitness community CFSBK is.  When I think about the gym, I think about Community Potlucks, Crash-B rowing programs, Strength Cycle, volunteering for Iron Maidens, and running workouts at Red Hook. As a front desk staffer, I loved getting to know every member by name. I will never forget one of my first front desk shifts during a January blizzard that shut down the subway. Typically, CFSBK was open and David, after telling other coaches to stay home, manned the fort.

Sometimes I think about how and where I would live if I ever moved back to Brooklyn. In every version of my daydream, I always live walking distance from CFSBK and the gym is always a central part of my imagined new life.
