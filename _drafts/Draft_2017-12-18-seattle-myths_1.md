title:  "Seattle Myths Pt 1"

I have notice there are  a few little white lies that Seattlites tell each other about their city.  Prominent on the list, "Sure it rains here, but it really doesn't rain hard. Everyone goes outside and no one uses an umbrella."  The last bit, about umbrellas, is true, but it's a stupid thing to say because, actually,it often rains really hard.  I live a ten minute walk away from my gym and in the last month there have been at least 5 days on which I had to wear boots or other waterproof shoes instead of going in my 'trainers.'  So if you are going to come to Seattle, be prepared for at least some hard rain!
