    <p>2017 was a big year for me. After spending Q1 living with Jono on NYC’s UWS, I drove cross-country and transplanted myself to Seattle.</p>

<p>I am proud to have accomplished a number of things during the year:</p>
<ul>
  <li>disengaged from work and other familiar patterns of every day life in NYC and reestablished healthy daily habits in Seattle.</li>
  <li>Spent significant time in Seattle building relationships, nurturing existing friendships, and acquainting myself with a few old friends I had not seen for a long time.</li>
  <li>Studied new technology throughout the year and, in particular, dove deeper into data science for the last 3 1/2 months. Data science has clicked with me like no other technology area. I believe it has helped me reach a new career frontier.</li>
  <li>Did a decent amount of exploring throughout the year by driving cross-country, traveling to a few different parts of the PNW, on brief trips to California,  Nicaragua, and Martha’s Vineyard (my first visit to an island I have heard about for many years).</li>
  <li>Reconciled myself with divorce and stayed friendly with AM. At same time, built foundations of a new relationship.</li>
  <li>Stayed in regular, close contact with my daughter and son, mainly via text messaging and social media, but also spent some nice phone and face-to-face time with each.</li>
  <li>Found two nice places to live in Seattle: a serene, beautiful landing pad in Ballard and a well-located, aesthetic 1BR in Capitol Hill which enabled me to consolidate my belongings and feel as though I am at home here.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also a few things that didn’t go as well:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I have not yet found full-time work in Seattle though it seems clear there are appropriate jobs out here. In past, networking has been enough to ‘land’ me something, but here it is not working.</li>
  <li>Related to no full-time work: too much anxiety. I have not been able to “trust the process” and accept that it will take a while. The meditation and exercise have helped in this area.</li>
  <li>Related to anxiety: I over-ate and gained pounds despite exercising actively throughout the year.</li>
</ul>

<p>These last few items provide areas to focus and improve in 2018. Am still considering whether, aside from remediating these areas, I wish to make any special resolution for the New Year.</p>
